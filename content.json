Each Page and Layout needs to be referenced there. You may want to read Routing first and also understand Lazy Loading / Code Splitting. Example of routes.js:// we define our routes in this fileimport LandingPage from 'pages/Landing'const routes = [ &#123; path: '/', component: LandingPage &#125;]export default routes Example of routes.js using lazy-loading / on-demand loading:// we define our routes in this fileconst routes = [ &#123; path: '/', component: () =&gt; import('pages/Landing') &#125;]export default routes Configuring routes to use Layouts and Pages basically consists in correctly nesting routes, as we’ll see in the next section. Nested RoutesReal app UIs are usually composed of components that are nested multiple levels deep. It is also very common that the segments of a URL corresponds to a certain structure of nested components, for example: /user/profile /user/posts+------------------+ +-----------------+| User | | User || +--------------+ | | +-------------+ || | Profile | | +------&gt; | | Posts | || | | | | | | || +--------------+ | | +-------------+ |+------------------+ +-----------------+ With Vue Router, it is very simple to express this relationship using nested route configurations. We notice some things: both pages need to be wrapped by a User component. Hey, User component is then a Layout! Let’s create these files:$ quasar new layout User app:new Generated layout: src/layouts/User.vue +0ms app:new Make sure to reference it in src/router/routes.js +2ms$ quasar new page Profile Posts app:new Generated page: src/pages/Profile.vue +0ms app:new Make sure to reference it in src/router/routes.js +2ms app:new Generated page: src/pages/Posts.vue +1ms app:new Make sure to reference it in src/router/routes.js +0ms Since User layout wraps inner pages, they need an injection point. This is supplied by &lt;router-view&gt; component:&lt;!-- /src/layouts/User.vue --&gt;&lt;template&gt; &lt;q-layout&gt; ... &lt;!-- this is where the Pages are injected --&gt; &lt;q-page-container&gt; &lt;router-view&gt;&lt;/router-view&gt; &lt;/q-page-container&gt; ... &lt;/q-layout&gt;&lt;/template&gt; &lt;!-- /src/pages/Profile.vue or Posts.vue --&gt;&lt;template&gt; &lt;q-page&gt; ...page content... &lt;/q-page&gt;&lt;/template&gt;` Our example has some routes specified (/user/profile and /user/posts). So how can we put everything together now? We edit the routes file. That’s where we will configure routes, tell which components are Layouts and which are Pages and also reference/import them into our app: // src/router/routes.jsimport User from 'layouts/User'import Profile from 'pages/Profile'import Posts from 'pages/Posts'const routes = [ &#123; path: '/user', // we use /src/layouts/User component which is imported above component: User, // hey, it has children routes and User has &lt;router-view&gt; in it; // It is really a Layout then! children: [ // Profile page &#123; path: 'profile', // here it is, route /user/profile component: Profile // we reference /src/pages/Profile.vue imported above &#125;, // Posts page &#123; path: 'posts', // here it is, route /user/posts component: Posts // we reference /src/pages/Posts.vue imported above &#125; ] &#125;]export default routes Note that nested paths that start with / will be treated as a root path. This allows you to leverage the component nesting without having to use a nested URL.

To achieve that, we can run the dev server and the API backend side-by-side (or remotely), and let the dev server proxy all API requests to the actual backend. This is useful if you access relative paths in your API requests. Obviously, these relative paths will probably not work while you are developing. In order to create an environment similar to the one used by your deployed website/app, you can proxy your API requests. To configure the proxy rules, edit /quasar.conf.js in devServer.proxy. You should refer to Webpack Dev Server Proxy docs for detailed usage. But here’s a simple example: // quasar.conf.jsdevServer: &#123; proxy: &#123; // proxy all requests starting with /api to jsonplaceholder '/api': &#123; target: 'http://some.api.target.com:7070', changeOrigin: true, pathRewrite: &#123; '^/api': '' &#125; &#125; &#125;&#125; The above example will proxy the request /api/posts/1 to http://some.api.target.com:7070/posts/1."},{"title":"Build Commands","updated":"2018-02-21T21:16:36.666Z","permalink":"http://quasar-framework.org/guide/app-build-commands.html","text":"We will be covering Development and Production build commands.

If your favorite deployment tool is missing feel free to create a pull request on GitHub to add it to the list. General deploymentThe first step in deploying you Quasar SPA is alway to build a production-ready bundle of your files, which gets rid of development statements and minifies your source. To produce such a build use Quasar CLI with the following command$ quasar build For possible build options please refer to the Quasar CLI docs. This command will build your project in SPA mode and output your production ready bundle to a newly created folder /dist/spa-&lt;theme&gt; were &lt;theme&gt; is replaced by the theme you chose to build with. To serve your production files it is required to use a web server, so to serve over http:// protocol. Simply opening the index.html file from within your browser will not work, since this uses file:// protocol instead. Common choices for web server are nginx, Caddy, Apache, Express, but you should be able to use whatever web server you want. The web server requires no special setup (unless you built with Vue Router in “history” mode). The main requirement is to be able to serve static files from a directory, so consult the documentation of your web server on how to set up static file serving. Deploying with NowDeploying your Quasar application with now is really easy. All you have to do is to download the now-cli and log in by running:$ now login Then proceed to build your Quasar application using the steps described in General deployment. After the build is finished, change directory into your deploy root (example: /dist/spa-mat) and run:$ now The Now CLI should now display information regarding your deployment, like the URL. That’s it. You’re done. Deploying with HerokuUnfortunately, Heroku does not support static sites out of the box. But don’t worry, we just need to add an HTTP server to our project so Heroku can serve our Quasar application. In this example, we will use Express to create a minimal server which Heroku can use. First, we need to install the required dependencies to our project:$ npm install express serve-static connect-history-api-fallback Now that we have installed the required dependencies we can add our server. Create a file called server.js in the root directory of your project.const express = require('express'), serveStatic = require('serve-static'), history = require('connect-history-api-fallback'), port = process.env.PORT || 5000const app = express()app.use(history())app.use(serveStatic(__dirname + '/dist/spa-&lt;theme&gt;'))app.listen(port) Make sure to exchange &lt;theme&gt; to the theme you use. Heroku assumes a set of npm scripts to be available, so we have to alter our package.json and add the following under the script section:\"build\": \"quasar build\",\"start\": \"node server.js\",\"heroku-postbuild\": \"npm install --only=dev --no-shrinkwrap &amp;&amp; npm run build\" Now it is time to create an app on Heroku by running:$ heroku create and deploy to Heroku using:$ heroku deploy Deploying with SurgeSurge is a popular tool to host and deploy static sites. If you want to deploy your application with Surge you first need to install the Surge CLI tool:$ npm install -g surge Next, we will use Quasar CLI to build our app:$ quasar build Now we can deploy our application using Surge by calling:# make sure to replace &lt;theme&gt; with your actual theme$ surge dist/spa-&lt;theme&gt; Now your application should be successfully deployed using Surge. You should be able to adapt this guide to any other static site deployment tool. Deploying on GitHub PagesTo deploy your Quasar application to GitHub pages the first step is to create a special repository on GitHub which is named &lt;username&gt;.github.io. Clone this repository to your local machine. Next, you need to build your Quasar application like it is described in the general deployment section. This will result in a spa-&lt;theme&gt; directory inside the dist directory. Copy the content of this folder to your cloned repository. The last step is to add a commit in your repository an push to GitHub. After a short time, you should be able to visit your Quasar application at https://.github.io/. Adding a custom domain to GitHub pagesPlease see the GitHub pages guides for an in-depth explanation on how to set up a custom domain. Automated deployment to GitHub pages with push-dirManual copying all your files to your GitHub Pages repository can be a cumbersome task to do. This step can be automated by using the push-dir package. First, install the package with:$ npm install push-dir --save-dev Then add a deploy script command to your package.json:// replace &lt;theme&gt; with your actual theme (mat, ios)\"scripts\": &#123; \"deploy\": \"push-dir --dir=dist/spa-&lt;theme&gt; --remote=gh-pages --branch=master\"&#125; Add your GitHub Pages repository as a remote named gh-pages:$ git remote add gh-pages git@github.com:&lt;username&gt;/&lt;username&gt;.github.io.git Now you can build and deploy your application using:$ quasar build$ npm run deploy which will push the content of your build directory to your master branch on your Github Pages repository."},{"title":"Directory Structure","updated":"2018-02-21T21:16:36.666Z","permalink":"http://quasar-framework.org/guide/app-directory-structure.html","text":"This is the structure of a project with all modes installed.

What is the difference between them? Some are static assets while the other are processed and embedded by the build system. Type of AssetsSo let’s try to answer the question above. We first discuss about using the regular assets then we’ll see what static assets means. Regular assets - /src/assetsIn *.vue components, all your templates and CSS are parsed by vue-html-loader and css-loader to look for asset URLs. For example, in &lt;img src=&quot;./logo.png&quot;&gt; and background: url(./logo.png), &quot;./logo.png&quot; is a relative asset path and will be resolved by Webpack as a module dependency. Because logo.png is not JavaScript, when treated as a module dependency, we need to use url-loader and file-loader to process it. Quasar CLI has already configured these webpack loaders for you, so you basically get features such as filename fingerprinting and conditional base64 inlining for free, while being able to use relative/module paths without worrying about deployment. Since these assets may be inlined/copied/renamed during build, they are essentially part of your source code. This is why it is recommended to place Webpack-processed assets inside /src/assets, along side other source files. In fact, you don’t even have to put them all in /src/assets: you can organize them based on the module/component using them. For example, you can put each component in its own directory, with its static assets right next to it. Asset Resolving RulesRelative URLs, e.g. ./assets/logo.png will be interpreted as a module dependency. They will be replaced with a auto-generated URL based on your Webpack output configuration. URLs prefixed with ~ are treated as a module request, similar to require(&#39;some-module/image.png&#39;). You need to use this prefix if you want to leverage Webpack’s module resolving configurations. Quasar provides assets Webpack alias out of the box, so it is recommended that you use it like this: &lt;img src=&quot;~assets/logo.png&quot;&gt;. Notice ~ in front of ‘assets’. Static Assets - /src/staticsRoot-relative URLs, e.g. /statics/logo.png or statics/logo.png are not processed at all. This should be placed in src/statics/. These won’t be processed by Webpack at all. The statics folder is simply copied over to the distributable folder as-is. Quasar has some smart algorithms behind the curtains which ensure that no matter what you build (SPA, PWA, Cordova, Electron), your statics are correctly referenced if and only if all your statics start with statics/ string. For this reason, do not use /statics as URL. &lt;!-- Good! --&gt;&lt;img src=\"statics/logo.png\"&gt;&lt;!-- BAD! Don't! --&gt;&lt;img src=\"/statics/logo.png\"&gt; Vue Binding Requires Statics OnlyPlease note that whenever you bind “src” to a variable in your Vue scope, it must be one from the statics folder. The reason is simple: the URL is dynamic, so Webpack (which packs up assets at compile time) doesn’t know which file you’ll be referencing at runtime, so it won’t process the URL. &lt;template&gt; &lt;!-- imageSrc MUST reference a file from /src/statics --&gt; &lt;img :src=\"imageSrc\"&gt;&lt;/template&gt;&lt;script&gt;export default &#123; data () &#123; return &#123; &lt;!-- Referencing /src/statics. Notice string doesn't start with a slash. (/) --&gt; imageSrc: 'statics/logo.png' &#125; &#125;&#125;&lt;/script&gt; IMPORTANTYou can force serving static assets by using src as a Vue property. Instead of src=&quot;statics/path/to/image&quot; use :src=&quot;&#39;statics/path/to/image&#39;&quot;. Please note the usage of single and double quotes. Getting Asset Paths in JavaScriptIn order for Webpack to return the correct asset paths, you need to use require(&#39;./relative/path/to/file.jpg&#39;), which will get processed by file-loader and returns the resolved URL. For example: computed: &#123; background () &#123; return require('./bgs/' + this.id + '.jpg') &#125;&#125; Note the above example will include every image under ./bgs/ in the final build. This is because Webpack cannot guess which of them will be used at runtime, so it includes them all."},{"title":"Main Starter Kit Installation","updated":"2018-03-03T16:04:29.497Z","permalink":"http://quasar-framework.org/guide/app-installation.html","text":"Using the Main Starter Kit is the recommended way to go in order to benefit from all Quasar can do for it.

First, we install Quasar CLI.

But when the code gets complex, with lots of layouts/pages/components, it won’t be optimal to do this as it will hurt the loading time. Fortunately, there is a way to solve this. We’ll cover how you can lazy load / code split parts of your app so that they are automatically requested only on demand. This is done through dynamic imports. Let’s start with an example and then convert it so that we use lazy loading – we’ll focus this example on loading a page, but the same principle can be applied to load anything (assets, JSONs, …): import SomePage from 'pages/SomePage'const routes = [ &#123; path: '/some-page', component: SomePage &#125;] Now let’s change this and make the page be loaded on demand only, using dynamic imports:const routes = [ &#123; path: '/some-page', component: () =&gt; import('pages/SomePage') &#125;] Easy, right? What this does is that it creates a separate chunk for /src/pages/SomePage.vue which can be loaded only when it is needed. In this case, when user visits the ‘/same-page’ route. As you noticed above, we’re using dynamic imports (import(&#39;..resource..&#39;)) instead of regular imports (import Resource from &#39;./path/to/resource&#39;). Dynamic imports are essentially returning a Promise that you can use: import('./categories.json') .then(categories =&gt; &#123; // hey, we have lazy loaded the file // and we have its content in \"categories\" &#125;) .catch(() =&gt; &#123; // ooops, something went wrong... // couldn't load the resource &#125;) One advantage of using dynamic imports as opposed to regular imports is that the import path can be determined at runtime: import('pages/' + pageName + '/' + 'id') Caveat for Dynamic ImportsThere’s one caveat when using dynamic imports with variable parts like in the previous example. When the website/app is bundled, so at compile time, we have no way of telling what the exact import path will be at runtime. As a result, chunks will be created for each file that could match the variable path. You might see un-necessary files in the build log. So how can we limit the number of chunks created in this case? The idea is to limit the variable part as much as you can so the matched paths are as few as possible. Add file extension, even if it works without it too. This will create chunks only for that file types. Useful when that folder contains many file types. // badimport('./folder/' + pageName)// much betterimport('./folder/' + pageName + '.vue') Try to create a folder structure that will limit the files available in that variable path. Make it as specific as possible: // bad -- makes chunks for any JSON inside ./folder (recursive search)const asset = 'my/jsons/categories.json'import('./folder/' + asset)// good -- makes chunks only for JSONs inside ./folder/my/jsonsconst asset = 'categories.json'import('./folder/my/jsons/' + asset) Try to import from folders containing only files. Take the previous example and imagine ./folder/my/jsons further contains sub-folders. We made the dynamic import better by specifying a more specific path, but it’s still not optimal in this case. Best is to use terminal folders that only contain files, so we limit the number of matched paths. Remember that the number of matched paths equals to the number of chunks being generated."},{"title":"App Linter","updated":"2018-02-21T21:16:36.668Z","permalink":"http://quasar-framework.org/guide/app-linter.html","text":"Having a code linter in place is highly recommended and ensures your code looks legible.

In earlier Quasar versions, to run code before the root Vue instance was instantiated, you could alter the /src/main.js file and add any code you needed to execute. There is one problem with this approach. With a growing project size your main.js file most likely would get very cluttered and hard to maintain, which breaks with Quasars concept of encouraging developers to write maintainable and elegant cross-platform applications. With app plugins, it is possible to split each of your dependency into a self-contained, easy to maintain file. It will also be very easy to disable any of the app plugins or even contextually determine which of the app plugins get into the build through quasar.conf.js configuration. Anatomy of an app pluginAn app plugin is a simple JavaScript file which needs to export a function. Quasar will then call the exported function when it boots the application and additionally pass an object with the following properties to the function: Prop name Description app Object with which the root component gets instantiated by Vue router Instance of Vue Router from ‘src/router/index.js’ store Instance of Vuex from ‘src/store/index.js’ - store only will be passed if your project uses Vuex (you have src/store) Vue Is same as if we do import Vue from &#39;vue&#39; and it’s there for convenience export default (&#123; app, router, store, Vue &#125;) =&gt; &#123; // something to do&#125; Notice we are using ES6 destructuring assignment. Only assign what you actually need/use. When to use app plugins IMPORTANTPlease make sure you understand what problem app plugins solve and when it is appropriate to use them, to avoid applying them in cases where they are not needed. App plugins fulfill one special purpose: they run code before the App’s Vue root component is instantiated while giving you access to certain variables, which is required if you need to initialize a library, interfere with Vue Router, inject Vue prototype or inject the root instance of the Vue app. Examples of appropriate usage of app plugins Your Vue plugin has installation instructions, like needing to call Vue.use() on it. Your Vue plugin requires instantiation of data that is added to the root instance - An example would be vue-i18n. You want to add something to the Vue prototype for convenient access - An example would be to be conveniently use this.$axios inside your Vue files instead of importing Axios in each such file. You want to interfere with the router - An example would be to use router.beforeEach for authentication You want to interfere with the Vuex store instance - An example would be to use vuex-router-sync package Configure aspects of libraries - An example would be to create an instance of Axios with a base URL; you can then inject it into Vue prototype and/or export it (so you can import the instance from anywhere else in your app) Examples of unneeded usage of app plugins For plain JavaScript libraries like Lodash, which don’t need any initialization prior to their usage. Lodash, for example, might only make sense to have an app plugin only if you want to inject Vue prototype with it, like being able to use this.$_ inside your Vue files. Make API requests - You probably want to do this inside your pages Vue component Usage of app pluginsThe first step is always to generate a new plugin using Quasar CLI: $ quasar new plugin &lt;name&gt; Where &lt;name&gt; should be exchanged by a suitable name for your plugin. This command creates a new file: /src/plugins/&lt;name&gt;.js with the following content: // import something here// leave the export, even if you don't use itexport default (&#123; app, router, store, Vue &#125;) =&gt; &#123; // something to do&#125; You can now add content to that file depending on what the intended use of your plugin is. Do not forget that your default export needs to be a function.However, you can have as many named exports as you want, should the plugin expose something for later usage. In this case, you can import any of these named exports anywhere in your app. The last step is to tell Quasar to use your new plugin. For this to happen you need to add the plugin in /quasar.conf.js plugins: [ '&lt;name&gt;' // references /src/plugins/&lt;name&gt;.js] Quasar App FlowIn order to better understand how and what a plugin does, you need to understand how your website/app is booted up: Quasar gets initialized (components, directives, plugins, Quasar i18n, Quasar icon sets) Quasar Extras get imported (Roboto font – if used, icons, animations, …) Quasar CSS &amp; your app’s global CSS is imported App.vue is loaded up (not yet being used) Store is imported (if using Vuex Store in src/store) App plugins are imported App plugins get their default export function executed, except for App Boot plugin (if on Electron mode) Electron is imported and injected into Vue prototype (if on Cordova mode) Listening for “deviceready” event and only then continuing with following steps (if App Boot plugin exists) Executing App Boot plugin (if no App Boot plugin exists) Instantiating Vue with root component and attaching to DOM Examples of app pluginsAxiosimport axios from 'axios'export default (&#123; Vue &#125;) =&gt; &#123; // we add it to Vue prototype // so we can reference it in Vue files // without the need to import axios Vue.prototype.$axios = axios // Example: this.$axios will reference Axios now so you don't need stuff like vue-axios&#125; vue-i18n// we import the external packageimport VueI18n from 'vue-i18n'// let's say we have a file in /src/i18n containing the language packimport messages from 'src/i18n'export default (&#123; app, Vue &#125;) =&gt; &#123; // we tell Vue to use our Vue package: Vue.use(VueI18n) // Set i18n instance on app; // We inject it into root component by doing so; // new Vue(&#123;..., i18n: ... &#125;).$mount(...) app.i18n = new VueI18n(&#123; locale: 'en', fallbackLocale: 'en', messages &#125;)&#125; Router authenticationSome plugins might need to interfere with Vue Router configuration:export default (&#123; router, store, Vue &#125;) =&gt; &#123; router.beforeEach((to, from, next) =&gt; &#123; // Now you need to add your authentication logic here like calling an API endpoint &#125;)&#125; Accessing data from pluginsSometimes you want to access data which you configure in your app plugin in files where you don’t have access to the root Vue instance. Fortunately, because app plugins are just normal JavaScript files you can add as many named exports to your app plugin as you want. Let’s take the example of Axios. Sometimes you want to access your Axios instance inside your JavaScript files, but you can not access the root Vue instance. To solve this you can export the Axios instance in your plugin and import it elsewhere. Consider the following plugin file for axios: // axios app plugin file (src/plugins/axios.js)import axios from 'axios'// We create our own axios instance and set a custom base URL.// Note that if we wouldn't set any config here we do not need// a named export, as we could just `import axios from 'axios'`const axiosInstance = axios.create(&#123; baseURL: 'https://api.example.com'&#125;)export default (&#123; Vue &#125;) =&gt; &#123; // for use inside Vue files through this.$axios Vue.prototype.$axios = axiosInstance&#125;// Here we define a named export// that we can later use inside .js files:export &#123; axiosInstance &#125; In any JavaScript file, you’ll be able to import the axios instance like this // we import one of the named exports from src/plugins/axios.jsimport &#123; axiosInstance &#125; from 'plugins/axios' Further reading on syntax: ES6 import, ES6 export. Special App Plugin: BootEvery Quasar website/app is booted up after plugins have been loaded and executed. The last step is to call new Vue() and attach it to the DOM. If for whatever reason, you need to control this final step and decide the specific moment when Vue kicks in, you can create a special Quasar plugin named “boot” (requires Quasar v0.15.6+). Remember to only use this plugin for eventually calling new Vue(app). Don’t use this for initializing any library you may have – for that, use a regular app plugin. # we create the boot plugin$ quasar new plugin boot app:new Generated plugin: src/plugins/boot.js +0ms app:new Make sure to reference it in quasar.conf.js &gt; plugins +2ms We then add this plugin to app plugins list in /quasar.conf.js:module.export = function (ctx) &#123; return &#123; plugin: [ &apos;boot&apos; ], ... &#125;&#125; IMPORTANTThe name “boot” for your plugin has a special meaning to Quasar CLI. It runs this plugin after all other app initialization has been executed and right before kicking off Vue with new Vue(). By adding this plugin you are responsible for kicking off Vue yourself, as we’ll see next. We edit our new plugin (/src/plugins/boot.js):export default (&#123; app, Vue &#125;) =&gt; &#123; // do some logic here... // ... then, kick off our Quasar website/app: new Vue(app) // \"app\" has everything cooked in by Quasar CLI, // you don't need to inject it with anything at this point&#125; IMPORTANTDo not forget to have at least one decisional branch where you call new Vue(app) otherwise your app won’t boot and you’ll only see a blank page!"},{"title":"App Pre-Processors & Webpack","updated":"2018-03-26T17:48:30.236Z","permalink":"http://quasar-framework.org/guide/app-pre-processors-and-webpack.html","text":"The build system uses Webpack to create your website/app. Don’t worry if you aren’t acquainted with Webpack. Out of the box, you won’t need to configure it because it already has everything set up. However, for cases where you need to tweak the default Webpack config you can do so by editing /quasar.conf.js and configuring build &gt; extendWebpack (cfg) method. Example of adding ESLint loader to it (assuming you’ve installed it):build: &#123; extendWebpack (cfg) &#123; cfg.module.rules.push(&#123; enforce: 'pre', test: /\\.(js|vue)$/, loader: 'eslint-loader', exclude: /(node_modules|quasar)/ &#125;) &#125;&#125; Notice that you don’t need to return anything. The parameter of extendWebpack(cfg) is the Webpack configuration Object generated by Quasar for you. You can add/remove/replace anything from it, assuming you really know what you are doing. Let’s discuss about Webpack loaders now. It’s probably where you’ll make the most additions. Webpack AliasesQuasar comes with a bunch of useful Webpack aliases preconfigured.You can use them anywhere in your project and webpack will resolve the correct path. If you want to add you own alias, se the section about adding your own alias to Webpack. Alias Resolves to quasar node_modules/quasar-framework/dist/quasar.&lt;configured-theme&gt;.esm.js src /src components /src/components layouts /src/layouts pages /src/pages assets /src/assets plugins /src/plugins variables /.quasar/variables.styl Also if you configure to build with the Vue compiler version (build &gt; vueCompiler: true), vue$ resolves to vue/dist/vue.esm.js. Webpack LoadersThe build system uses Webpack, so it relies on using webpack loaders to handle different types of files (js, css, styl, scss, json, and so on). By default, the most used loaders are provided by default. Installing loaders:Let’s take an example. You want to be able to import .json files. Out of the box, Quasar supplies json support so you don’t actually need to follow these steps, but for the sake of demonstrating how to add a loader, we’ll pretend Quasar doesn’t offer it. So, you need a loader for it. You search Google to see what webpack loader you need. In this case, it’s “json-loader”. We first npm install it:$ npm install json-loader --save-dev After installing your new loader, we want to tell Webpack to use it. So we edit /quasar.conf.js and change build.extendWebpack() to add entries to module/rules for this new loader: build: &#123; extendWebpack (cfg) &#123; cfg.module.rules.push(&#123; test: /\\.json$/, loader: 'json-loader' &#125;) &#125;&#125; And you’re done. SASS/SCSS supportSo you want to be able to write SASS/SCSS CSS code. You need a loader for it. We first npm install it. Note that for this particular case you also need to install node-sass because sass-loader depends on it as a peer dependency. $ npm install sass-loader node-sass --save-dev And you’re done. For SCSS/SASS it’s all it takes. You don’t need to further configure /quasar.conf.js. Once installed, you can use this pre-processor inside your *.vue components using the lang attribute on &lt;style&gt; tags: &lt;style lang=\"scss\"&gt;/* We can write SASS now! */&lt;/style&gt; A note on SASS syntax: lang=”scss” corresponds to the CSS-superset syntax (with curly braces and semicolons). lang=”sass” corresponds to the indentation-based syntax. PostCSSStyles in *.vue files (and all other style files) are piped through PostCSS by default, so you don’t need to use a specific loader for it. By default, PostCSS is configured to use Autoprefixer. Take a look at `/.postcssrc.js where you can tweak it if you need to. CoffeescriptIf you are using Coffeescript then you need to EITHER disable ESLint OR tell ESLint which Vue components are using Coffeescript. Note that vue-loader uses lang=&quot;coffee&quot; to identify components which are using Coffeescript, but lang=&quot;coffee&quot; is not recognizable for ESLint. Fortunately, ESLint (following traditional HTML) uses type=&quot;xxx&quot; to identify the type of scripts. As long as a &lt;script&gt; tag has any type other than javascript, ESLint would mark the script as non-javascript, and skips linting it. Coffeescript’s convention is to use type=&quot;text/coffeescript&quot; to identify itself. Therefore, in your Vue components which are using Coffeescript, using both lang and type to avoid ESLint warnings: &lt;template&gt; ...&lt;/template&gt;&lt;script lang=\"coffee\" type=\"text/coffeescript\"&gt; ...&lt;/script&gt;"},{"title":"Configuring quasar.conf.js","updated":"2018-03-26T17:48:30.236Z","permalink":"http://quasar-framework.org/guide/app-quasar.conf.js.html","text":"Quasar Starter Kit makes use of some awesome tools under the cover, like Webpack. Fortunately, the complexity of configuring the underlying tools is managed by Quasar CLI which does the heavy lifting for you. As a result, you don’t even need to know Webpack in order to use Quasar. So what can you configure through /quasar.conf.js? Quasar components, directives and plugins that you’ll be using in your website/app. Default Quasar I18n language pack Icon pack(s) that you wish to use Default icon set for Quasar components Development server port, HTTPS mode, hostname and so on CSS animations that you wish to use App Plugins list (that determines order of execution too) – which are files in /src/plugins that tell how your app is initialized before mounting the root Vue component Global CSS/Stylus/… files to be included in the bundle What should be added or removed from “vendor” chunk PWA manifest Electron Packager IE11+ support Extend Webpack config Object You’ll notice that changing any of these settings does not require you to manually reload the dev server. Quasar detects if the changes can be injected through Hot Module Reload and in case it can’t, it will reload the dev server for you. You won’t lose your development flow as you will just sit back while Quasar CLI quickly takes care of it. /quasar.conf.js is run by the Quasar CLI build system, so this code runs under Node directly, not in the context of your app. So you can require modules like ‘fs’, ‘path’, ‘webpack’ and so on. Make sure the ES6 features that you want to write this file with are supported by the installed version of your Node (which should be &gt;= 8.9.0). StructureYou’ll notice that /quasar.conf.js exports a function that takes a ctx (context) parameter and returns an Object. This allows you to dynamically change your website/app config based on this context: module.exports = function (ctx) &#123; console.log(ctx) // Example output on console: &#123; dev: true, prod: false, theme: &#123; mat: true &#125;, themeName: 'mat', mode: &#123; spa: true &#125;, modeName: 'spa', target: &#123;&#125;, targetName: undefined, arch: &#123;&#125;, archName: undefined, debug: undefined &#125; // context gets generated based on the parameters // with which you run \"quasar dev\" or \"quasar build\"&#125; What this means is that, as an example, you can load a font when building with Quasar Material theme, and pick another one for Quasar iOS theme.module.exports = function (ctx) &#123; extras: [ ctx.theme.mat ? 'roboto-font' // we're building with Material theme : null // we're not building with Material theme, so it's iOS theme ]&#125; Or you can use a global CSS file for SPA mode and another one for Cordova mode while avoiding loading any such file for the other modes.module.exports = function (ctx) &#123; css: [ ctx.mode.spa ? 'app-spa.styl' : null, // looks for /src/css/app-spa.styl ctx.mode.cordova ? 'app-cordova.styl' : null // looks for /src/css/app-cordova.styl ]&#125; Or you can configure the dev server to run on port 8000 for SPA mode, on port 9000 for PWA mode or on port 9090 for the other modes:module.exports = function (ctx) &#123; devServer: &#123; port: ctx.mode.spa ? 8000 : (ctx.mode.pwa ? 9000 : 9090) &#125;&#125; The possibilities are endless. Options to ConfigureLet’s take each option one by one: Property Type Description css Array Global CSS/Stylus/… files from /src/css/, except for themes files which are included by default. Example: [‘app.styl’] (referring /src/css/app.styl) extras Array What to import from quasar-extras package. Example: [‘material-icons’, ‘roboto-font’, ‘ionicons’] supportIE Boolean Add support for IE11+. framework Object/String What Quasar components/directives/plugins to import, what Quasar I18n language pack to use, what icon set to use for Quasar components. Example: { components: [‘QBtn’, ‘QIcon’], directives: [‘TouchSwipe’], plugins: [‘Notify’], iconSet: ‘fontawesome’, i18n: ‘de’ }. Note that for iconSet to work, you also need to tell Quasar to embed that icon pack through extras prop. animations Object/String What CSS animations to import. Example: [‘bounceInLeft’, ‘bounceOutRight’] devServer Object Dev server options. Some properties are overwritten based on the Quasar mode you’re using in order to ensure a correct config. build Object Build configuration options. See section below. cordova Object Cordova specific config. pwa Object PWA specific config. electron Object Electron specific config. DevServer PropertyTake a look at full list of options. Some are overwritten by Quasar CLI based on “quasar dev” parameters and Quasar mode in order to ensure a correct setup. Most used properties are: Property Type Description port Number Port of dev server host String Local IP/Host to use for dev server open Boolean Open up browser pointing to dev server address automatically. Applies to SPA and PWA modes. Build Property Property Type Description extendWebpack(cfg) Function Extend Webpack config generated by Quasar CLI. publicPath String Public path of your app. By default, it uses the root. Use it when your public path is something else, like “&lt;protocol&gt;://&lt;domain&gt;/some/nested/folder” – in this case, it means the distributables are in “some/nested/folder” on your webserver. vueRouterMode String Sets Vue Router mode: ‘hash’ or ‘history’. Pick wisely. History mode requires configuration on your deployment web server too. useNotifier Boolean Use native OS notification to tell dev/build outcome or when your code has linting issues while developing. Useful if you’re not keeping an eye on the terminal console. Some OSes might not support this though. htmlFilename String Default is ‘index.html’. productName String Default value is taken from package.json &gt; productName field. distDir String Folder where Quasar CLI should generate the distributables. Relative path to project root directory. Default is ‘dist/{ctx.modeName}-{ctx.themeName}’. Applies to all Modes except for Cordova (which is forced to src-cordova/www). devtool String Source map strategy to use. env Object Add properties to process.env that you can use in your website/app JS code. Each property needs to be JSON encoded. Example: { SOMETHING: JSON.stringify(‘someValue’) }. gzip Boolean Gzip the distributables. Useful when the web server with which you are serving the content does not have gzip. scopeHoisting Boolean Default: true. Use Webpack scope hoisting for slightly better runtime performance. analyze Boolean/Object Show analysis of build bundle with webpack-bundle-analyzer. If using as Object, it represents the webpack-bundle-analyzer config Object. vueCompiler Boolean (Quasar v0.15.7+) Include vue runtime + compiler version, instead of default Vue runtime-only The following properties of build are automatically configured by Quasar CLI depending on dev/build commands and Quasar mode. But if you like to override some (make sure you know what you are doing), you can do so: Property Type Description extractCSS Boolean Extract CSS from Vue files sourceMap Boolean Use source maps minify Boolean Minify code (html, js, css) webpackManifest Boolean Improves caching strategy. Use a webpack manifest file to avoid cache bust on vendor chunk changing hash on each build. If, for example, you run “quasar build –debug”, sourceMap and extractCSS will be set to “true” regardless of what you configure. Example setting env for dev/buildbuild: &#123; env: ctx.dev ? &#123; // so on dev we'll have API: JSON.stringify('https://dev.api.com') &#125; : &#123; // and on build (production): API: JSON.stringify('https://prod.api.com') &#125;&#125; Then in your website/app you can access process.env.API and it’s gonna point to one of those two links above, based on dev or production build type. You can even go one step further. Supply it with values taken from the quasar dev/build env variables:# we set an env variable in terminal$ MY_API=api.com quasar build# then we pick it up in /quasar.conf.jsbuild: &#123; env: ctx.dev ? &#123; // so on dev we&apos;ll have API: JSON.stringify(&apos;https://dev.&apos;+ process.env.MY_API) &#125; : &#123; // and on build (production): API: JSON.stringify(&apos;https://prod.&apos;+ process.env.MY_API) &#125;&#125; Extending Webpack Config ObjectThis is achieved through build &gt; extendWebpack() Function. Example adding a Webpack loader. // quasar.conf.jsbuild: &#123; extendWebpack (cfg) &#123; // we make in-place changes cfg.modules.rules.push(&#123; test: /\\.json$/, loader: 'json-loader' &#125;) // no need to return anything &#125;&#125; Adding you own alias to WebpackTo add you own alias you can extend the webpack config and merge it with the existing alias.Use the path.resolve helper to resolve the path to your intended alias. // quasar.conf.jsbuild: &#123; extendWebpack (cfg) &#123; cfg.resolve.alias = &#123; ...cfg.resolve.alias, // This adds the existing alias // Add you own alias like this myalias: path.resolve(__dirname, './src/somefolder'), &#125;&#125;"},{"title":"App Routing","updated":"2018-02-21T21:16:36.669Z","permalink":"http://quasar-framework.org/guide/app-routing.html","text":"You’ll notice that your Quasar project contains a /src/router folder.

It is often overlooked that the source of truth in Vue instances is the raw data object - a Vue instance simply proxies access to it. Therefore, if you have a piece of state that should be shared by multiple instances, you should avoid duplicating it and share it by identity. The recommended way to go if you want components sharing state is Vuex. Take a look at its documentation before diving in. It has a great feature when used along the Vue dev-tools browser extension like Time Travel debugging. We won’t go into details on how to configure or use Vuex since it has great docs. Instead we’ll just show you what the folder structure looks like when using it on a Quasar project. .└── src/ └── store/ # Vuex Store ├── index.js # Vuex Store definition ├── &lt;folder&gt; # Vuex Store Module... └── &lt;folder&gt; # Vuex Store Module... By default, if you choose to use Vuex when you create a project folder with Quasar CLI, it will set you up on using Vuex modules. Each sub-folder of /src/store represents a Vuex Module. If Vuex Modules is too much for your website app, you can change /src/store/index.js and avoid importing any module. Adding a Vuex Module.Adding a Vuex Module is made easy by Quasar CLI through the $ quasar new command.$ quasar new store &lt;store_name&gt; It will create a folder in /src/store named by “store_name” from the command above. It will contain all the boilerplate that you need. Let’s say that you want to create a “showcase” Vuex Module. You issue $ quasar new store showcase. You then notice the newly created /src/store/showcase folder which holds the following files: .└── src/ └── store/ ├── index.js # Vuex Store definition └── showcase # Module \"showcase\" ├── index.js # Glueing the module together ├── actions.js # Module actions ├── getters.js # Module getters ├── mutations.js # Module mutations └── state.js # Module state We’ve created the new Vuex Module, but we haven’t yet informed Vuex to use it. So we edit /src/store/index.js and add a reference to it: import Vue from 'vue'import Vuex from 'vuex'// we first import the moduleimport showcase from './showcase'Vue.use(Vuex)const store = new Vuex.Store(&#123; modules: &#123; // then we reference it showcase &#125;&#125;)// if we want some HMR magic for it, we handle// the hot update like below.

Before we dive in, make sure you got the Cordova CLI installed.$ npm install -g cordova Developing$ quasar dev -m cordova -T [ios|android]# ..or the longer form:$ quasar dev --mode cordova -T [ios|android]# with a specific Quasar theme, for iOS platform:$ quasar dev -m cordova -T ios -t ios# with a specific Quasar theme, for Android platform:$ quasar dev -m cordova -T android -t mat# using a specific emulator (--emulator, -e)$ quasar dev -m cordova -T android -e iPhone-7 IMPORTANTYou can develop with any Quasar theme, regardless of the platform you are building on (Android, IOS, …). In order for you to be able to develop on a device emulator or directly on a phone (with Hot Module Reload included), Quasar CLI follows these steps: Detects your machine’s external IP address. If there are multiple such IPs detected, then it asks you to choose one. If you’ll be using a mobile phone to develop then choose the IP address of your machine that’s pingable from the phone/tablet. It starts up a development server on your machine. It temporarily changes the &lt;content/&gt; tag in /src-cordova/config.xml to point to the IP previously detected. This allows the app to connect to the development server. It defers to Cordova CLI to build a native app with the temporary changed config.xml. Cordova CLI looks if a mobile phone / tablet is connected to your development machine. If it is, it installs the development app on it. If none is found, then it boots up an emulator and runs the development app. Finally, it reverts the temporary changes made to /src-cordova/config.xml. IMPORTANTIf developing on a mobile phone/tablet, it is very important that the external IP address of your build machine must be accessible from the phone/tablet, otherwise you’ll get a development app with white screen only. Also check your machine’s firewall to allow connections to the development chosen port. Building for Production$ quasar build -m cordova -T [ios|android]# ..or the longer form:$ quasar build --mode cordova -T [ios|android]# with a specific Quasar theme, for iOS platform:$ quasar build -m cordova -T ios -t ios# with a specific Quasar theme, for Android platform:$ quasar build -m cordova -T android -t mat IMPORTANTYou can build with any Quasar theme, regardless of the platform you are targeting (Android, IOS, …). These commands parse and build your /src folder then overwrite /src-cordova/www then deffer to Cordova CLI to trigger the actual native app creation. You may ask yourself. So where’s the .apk or .app?

There are two configuration files of great importance to your mobile apps. We’ll go over each one. Config.xmlThe most important config file for your mobile app is /src-cordova/config.xml. Like mentioned above, /src-cordova is a Cordova project folder, so please refer to Cordova documentation in order to understand what each file from there does. But for now, have a few moments to read about config.xml. Some properties from this file will get overwritten as we’ll see in next section. Quasar.conf.jsQuasar CLI helps you in setting some properties of the mobile Apps automatically (from config.xml): the Cordova “id”, app version and description. This is for convenience so you’ll be able to have a single point where, for example, you change the version of your app, not multiple files that you need to simultaneously touch which is error prone. For determining the values for each of the properties mentioned above, Quasar CLI: Looks in /quasar.conf.js for a “cordova” Object. Does it has “id”, “version” and/or “description”? If yes, it’ll use it/them. If not, then it looks into your /package.json for “cordovaId”, “version” and “description” fields."},{"title":"What is Cordova","updated":"2018-02-21T21:16:36.671Z","permalink":"http://quasar-framework.org/guide/cordova-introduction.html","text":"Apache Cordova is a mobile application development framework originally created by Nitobi. Adobe Systems purchased Nitobi in 2011, rebranded it as PhoneGap, and later released an open source version of the software called Apache Cordova. Apache Cordova enables software programmers to build applications for mobile devices using CSS3, HTML5, and JavaScript instead of relying on platform-specific APIs like those in Android, iOS, or Windows Phone. It enables wrapping up of CSS, HTML, and JavaScript code depending upon the platform of the device. It extends the features of HTML and JavaScript to work with the device. The resulting applications are hybrid, meaning that they are neither truly native mobile application (because all layout rendering is done via Web views instead of the platform’s native UI framework) nor purely Web-based (because they are not just Web apps, but are packaged as apps for distribution and have access to native device APIs). You can hook into the native device APIs by using Cordova Plugins."},{"title":"Managing Google Analytics","updated":"2018-02-21T21:16:36.671Z","permalink":"http://quasar-framework.org/guide/cordova-managing-google-analytics.html","text":"Getting to know your users and measuring user behavior is an important step in App Development. Unfortunately, it takes a bit of non-standard work to get Google Analytics to work after wrapping your mobile app with Cordova. Setting up Google Analytics in a pure web application is quite easy, but Cordova somehow prevents pageviews and events from being sent to Google Analytics. Follow this guide to implement Google Analytics into your Cordova powered Quasar App. IMPORTANTYou’ll need to include a &lt;script&gt; tag provided by Google in /src/index.template.html, which will make your App depend on an Internet connection! Prerequisites Make sure all your routes have a name and path parameter specified. Otherwise, they cannot be posted to the ga.logPage function. Please refer to Routing for more info on routing. Have Basic knowledge of Google Analytics PreparationBefore we can start implementing Google Analytics into your application, you’ll need an account for Google Analytics and Google Tagmanager. So let’s do that first. When you have these accounts, it’s time to configure Tag manager. Follow the steps in this Multiminds article to do so. Implementing this into application For this guide, we’ll assume you have a fixed sessionId that you send to Google Analytics. Google Analytics uses a sessionId to distinquish different users from each other. If you want to create an anonymous sessionId, see Analytics Documentation on user id. Place the Tag Manager snippet into head of your index.html file (if you’ve followed the Multiminds article, you already have this.) Create a new file in your codebase called analytics.js with the following contents: export default &#123; logEvent(category, action, label, sessionId = null) &#123; dataLayer.push(&#123; 'appEventCategory': category, 'appEventAction': action, 'appEventLabel': label, 'sessionId': sessionId &#125;) dataLayer.push(&#123; 'event': 'appEvent' &#125;) &#125;, logPage(path, name, sessionId = null) &#123; dataLayer.push(&#123; 'screenPath': path, 'screenName': name, 'sessionId': sessionId &#125;) dataLayer.push(&#123; 'event': 'appScreenView' &#125;) &#125;&#125; To make sure all the pages in your application are automatically posted towards Google Analytics, we create an app plugin:$ quasar new plugin google-analytics Then we edit the newly created file: /src/plugins/google-analytics:import ga from &apos;analytics.js&apos;export default (&#123; router &#125;) =&gt; &#123; router.afterEach((to, from) =&gt; &#123; ga.logPage(to.path, to.name, sessionId) &#125;)&#125; Finally we register the app plugin in /quasar.conf.js. We can do so only for Cordova wrapped apps if we want:plugins: [ ctx.mode.cordova ? &apos;google-analytics&apos; : &apos;&apos;] More information about events can be found in the Analytics documentation on events. You’ll see the events and pageviews coming in when you run your app. It usually takes around 5 to 10 seconds for a pageview to be registered in the realtime view."},{"title":"Cordova Plugins","updated":"2018-02-21T21:16:36.672Z","permalink":"http://quasar-framework.org/guide/cordova-plugins.html","text":"You can hook into the native device APIs by using Cordova Plugins. Cordova PluginsA few examples of such plugins: Battery Status Camera Contacts Device Device Motion Geolocation Media Media Capture Network Information Splashscreen Vibration Statusbar Deviceready EventYou’ll notice that some Cordova plugins are usable only after the deviceready event has been triggered. We don’t need to worry about it too much. Quasar listens to this event and takes care of our root Vue component to be mounted after this event has been triggered. CaveatLet’s take a vue file for example:&lt;template&gt; ... we are sure 'deviceready' has been triggered here ...&lt;/template&gt;&lt;script&gt;// outside of the default export,// we need to listen to the event for ourselves:document.addEventListener('deviceready', () =&gt; &#123; // it's only now that we are sure // the event has triggered&#125;, false)export default &#123; // we are sure 'deviceready' has been triggered here&#125;&lt;/script&gt; The reason is simple. Quasar listens for the event then mounts the root Vue component. But before this, the Vue files are imported into the /src/router/routes.js file, so the code outside of the default export gets executed. Using a Cordova PluginLet’s learn by taking some examples, assuming you’ve added Cordova mode to your Quasar project and installed a platform (android, ios, …) already. Example: Battery StatusFirst step is to read the documentation of the Cordova plugin that we want to use. We look at Cordova Plugins list and click on Battery Status doc page. We see instructions on how to install this plugin. It’s always a Cordova command. So we “cd” into /src-cordova (which is a Cordova generated folder) and issue the install command form there:# from /src-cordova:$ cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-battery-status Now let’s put this plugin to some good use. In one of your Quasar project’s pages/layouts/components Vue file, we write: // some Vue file// remember this is simply an example;// only look at how we use the API described in the plugin's page;// the rest of things here are of no importance&lt;template&gt; &lt;div&gt; Battery status is: &lt;strong&gt;&#123;&#123; batteryStatus &#125;&#125;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/template&gt;&lt;script&gt;export default &#123; data () &#123; return &#123; batteryStatus: 'determining...' &#125; &#125;, methods: &#123; updateBatteryStatus (status) &#123; this.batteryStatus = `Level: $&#123;status.level&#125;, plugged: $&#123;status.isPlugged&#125;` &#125; &#125; created () &#123; // we register the event like on plugin's doc page window.addEventListener('batterystatus', this.updateBatteryStatus, false) &#125;, beforeDestroy () &#123; // we make some cleanup; // we need to remove the event listener window.removeEventListener('batterystatus', this.updateBatteryStatus, false) &#125;&#125;&lt;/script&gt; Example: CameraFirst step is to read the documentation of the Cordova plugin that we want to use. We look at Cordova Plugins list and click on Camera doc page. There’s a mention of the deviceready event. But we already know how to handle it from the previous sections. We see instructions on how to install this plugin. It’s always a Cordova command.

InstallationFirst step is to make sure you got the Cordova CLI installed and the necessary SDKs.$ npm install -g cordova After this step you will need to install the Android platform SDK on your machine. You can download the Android Studio here and follow these installation steps afterwards. Update your ~/.bashrc file to contain the correct paths to your installation of Android Studio: export ANDROID_HOME=\"$HOME/Android/Sdk\"PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools; PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools Start Android studio by changing into the folder you installed it in and run ./studio.sh. Next step is to install the individual SDKs: Open the “Configure” menu at the bottom of the window: Select the desired SDKs. As per May 2017 Cordova supports 4.4 and up and click on “Apply” to install the SDKs. 2. Add Cordova Quasar ModeIn order to develop/build a Mobile app, we need to add the Cordova mode to our Quasar project. What this does is that it uses Cordova CLI to generate a Cordova project in /src-cordova folder. /src-cordova/www folder will be overwritten each time you build.$ quasar mode -a cordova You can now verify if everything is in order. “cd” into /src-cordova and type:$ cordova requirements On some newer Debian-based operating systems you might face a very persistent problem when running cordova requiremets. Please see the “Android SDK not found” after installation section for assistance. 3. Start DevelopingIf you want to jump right in and start developing, you can skip the previous step with “quasar mode” command and issue:$ quasar dev -m cordova -T [android|ios] This will add Cordova mode automatically, if it is missing."},{"title":"Publishing to Store","updated":"2018-03-03T16:04:29.500Z","permalink":"http://quasar-framework.org/guide/cordova-publishing-to-store.html","text":"So you’ve finished working on your Mobile App. Now it’s time to deploy it. Let’s learn how. Android PublishingTo generate a release build for Android, we can use the following Quasar CLI command:$ quasar build -m cordova -T android# optionally picking a Quasar theme too$ quasar build -m cordova -T android -t mat This will generate a release build based on the settings in your /src-cordova/config.xml. Next, we can find our unsigned APK file in /src-cordova/platforms/android/build/outputs/apk. Filename usually ends with “-release-unsigned.apk”. Now, we need to sign the unsigned APK and run an alignment utility on it to optimize it and prepare it for the app store. If you already have a signing key, skip these steps and use that one instead. Let’s generate our private key using the keytool command that comes with the JDK. If this tool isn’t found, refer to the installation guide: $ keytool -genkey -v -keystore my-release-key.keystore -alias alias_name -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 20000 You’ll first be prompted to create a password for the keystore. Then, answer the rest of the nice tools’s questions and when it’s all done, you should have a file called my-release-key.keystore created in the current directory. NoteMake sure to save this file somewhere safe, if you lose it you won’t be able to submit updates to your app! To sign the unsigned APK, run the jarsigner tool which is also included in the JDK: $ jarsigner -verbose -sigalg SHA1withRSA -digestalg SHA1 -keystore my-release-key.keystore &lt;path-to-unsigned-apk-file&gt; alias_name This signs the apk in place. Finally, we need to run the zip align tool to optimize the APK. The zipalign tool can be found in /path/to/Android/sdk/build-tools/VERSION/zipalign. For example, on OS X with Android Studio installed, zipalign is in ~/Library/Android/sdk/build-tools/VERSION/zipalign: $ zipalign -v 4 &lt;path-to-same-apk-file&gt; HelloWorld.apk Now we have our final release binary called HelloWorld.apk and we can release this on the Google Play Store for all the world to enjoy! (There are a few other ways to sign APKs. Refer to the official Android App Signing documentation for more information.) Google Play StoreNow that we have our release APK ready for the Google Play Store, we can create a Play Store listing and upload our APK. To start, you’ll need to visit the Google Play Store Developer Console and create a new developer account. Unfortunately, this is not free. However, the cost is only $25 compared to Apple’s $99. Once you have a developer account, you can go ahead and click “Publish an Android App on Google Play”. Then, you can go ahead and click the button to edit the store listing (We will upload an APK later). You’ll want to fill out the description for the app. When you are ready, upload the APK for the release build and publish the listing. Be patient and your hard work should be live in the wild! Updating your AppAs you develop your app, you’ll want to update it periodically. In order for the Google Play Store to accept updated APKs, you’ll need to bump the app version (from /package.json or from /quasar.conf.js &gt; cordova &gt; version, then rebuild the app for release. iOS PublishingFirst, you need to enroll in Apple Developer Program. As with Google, if you have a personal account with Apple, you can create an additional one for your applications. Connecting Xcode with your developer accountAfter you receive your developer status, open Xcode on your Mac and go to Preferences &gt; Accounts and add your account to Xcode by clicking the + button on the lower left hand side, and follow the instructions. SigningNow that you linked Xcode with your developer account, go to Preferences &gt; Accounts, select your Apple Id on the left hand side and then click the View Details button shown on the previous image. Click the Create button next to the iOS Distribution option. You can learn more about maintaining your signing identities and certificates from the official documentation. Setting up the app identifierNext, through the Apple Developer Member Center we’ll set up the app ID identifier details. Identifiers are used to allow an app to have access to certain app services like for example Apple Pay. You can login to Apple Developer Member Center with your Apple ID and password. Once you’re logged in you should choose Certificates, Identifiers, and Profiles option. Also select the Identifiers option under the iOS Apps. Then select the + button in order to add a new iOS App ID. Then you’ll have to set the name of your app, and use the Explicit App ID option and set the Bundle ID to the value of the id in your Cordova config.xml tag. Additionally, you’ll have to choose any of the services that need to be enabled. For example, if you use Apple Pay or Wallet in your app, you need to choose those option. You can learn more about registering app identifiers from the official documentation. Creating the app listingApple uses iTunes Connect to manage app submissions. After you login, you should select the My Apps button, and on the next screen select the + button, just below the iTunes Connect My Apps header. This will show three options in a dropdown, and you should select the New App. After this the popup appears where you have to choose the name of the application, platform, primary language, bundle ID and SKU. Once you’re done, click on the Create button and you’ll be presented with a screen where you’ll have to set some basic options like Privacy Policy URL, category and sub category. Now, before we fill out everything in the listing, we’ll build our app and get it uploaded with Xcode. Then you’ll come back to finish the listing. You can learn more about managing your app in iTunes Connect from the official documentation. Building the app for production$ quasar build -m cordova -T [android|ios] -t [mat|ios] If everything went well you’ll see the BUILD SUCCEEDED output in the console. Opening the project in XcodeNow, open the /src-cordova/platforms/ios/&lt;name&gt;.xcodeproj file in Xcode. Once the Xcode opens up the project, you should see the details about your app in the general view. You should just check that the bundle identifier is set up correctly, so that it’s the same as the value you specified earlier in the app ID. Also, make sure that the version and build numbers are correct. Team option should be set to your Apple developer account. Under the deployment target you can choose which devices your application will support. Creating an archive of the applicationIn Xcode, select Product &gt; Scheme &gt; Edit Scheme to open the scheme editor. Next, select the Archive from the list on the left hand side. Make sure that the Build configuration is set to Release. To create an archive choose a Generic iOS Device, or your device if it’s connected to your Mac (you can’t create an archive if simulator is selected), from the Scheme toolbar menu in the project editor. Next, select Product &gt; Archive, and the Archive organizer appears and displays the new archive. At this point you can click the Upload to App Store... button, and if everything goes fine you’ll have an uploaded app, and the only thing that’s left to do is to complete the iTunes Connect listing and submit it for review! At this point you should get an email from iTunes Connect shortly after you uploaded the archive with the content. Finishing the app list processNow you should head back to the iTunes Connect portal and login. Next, click on the Pricing and Availability on the left hand side under APP STORE INFORMATION. You don’t have to worry about forgetting to insert any crucial and required information about your application, since you’ll be notified about what’s missing and what needs to be added/changed if you try to submit the app for review before all details are filled in. Next, click on the 1.0 Prepare for Submission button on the left hand side, as shown on the image below. When we uploaded our archive, iTunes Connect automatically determined which device sizes are supported. You’ll need to upload at least one screenshot image for each of the various app sizes that were detected by iTunes Connect. Next you’ll have to insert Description, Keywords, Support URL and Marketing URL (optionally). In the Build section you have to click on the + button and select the build that was uploaded through Xcode in the previous steps. Next you’ll have to upload the icon, edit the rating, and set some additional info like copyright and your information. Note that the size of the icon that you’ll have to upload here will have to be 1024 by 1024 pixels. Thankfully, you can use the splash.png from the second tutorial. If you’re the sole developer then the data in the App Review Information should be your own. Finally, as the last option, you can leave the default checked option that once your app is approved that it is automatically released to the App Store. Now that we’re finished with adding all of the details to the app listing, we can press Save and then Submit for Review. Finally, you’ll be presented with the last form that you’ll have to fill out. After you submit your app for review you’ll see the status of it in the My Apps as Waiting for review, as shown on the image below. Also, shortly after you submit your app for review you’ll get a confirmation email from iTunes Connect that your app is in review. Apple prides itself with a manual review process, which basically means it can take several days for your app to be reviewed. You’ll be notified of any issues or updates to your app status. Updating the appSince you’ll probably want to update your app at some point you’ll you’ll first need to bump the app version (from /package.json or from /quasar.conf.js &gt; cordova &gt; version, then rebuild the app for release. Finally, you’ll have to open it up from the Xcode and follow the same steps all over again. Once you submit for the review, you’ll have to wait for the review process again."},{"title":"Cordova Troubleshoot and Tips","updated":"2018-02-21T21:16:36.673Z","permalink":"http://quasar-framework.org/guide/cordova-troubleshoot-and-tips.html","text":"Browser SimulatorUse Google Chrome’s emulator from Developer Tools.

Android SDK not found after installation of the SDKSome newer Debian-based OS (e.g. ubuntu, elementary OS) might leave you with a Android SDK not found. after you installed and (correctly) configured the environment. The output might look similar to this: $ cordova requirementsRequirements check results for android:Java JDK: installed 1.8.0Android SDK: installed trueAndroid target: not installedAndroid SDK not found.

The first step is to verify if your paths are set correctly. This can be done by running the following commands: $ echo $ANDROID_HOME The expected output should be a path similar to this $HOME/Android/Sdk. After this run: $ ls -la $ANDROID_HOME To ensure the folder contains the SDK.

It allows for the development of desktop GUI applications using front and back end components originally developed for web applications: Node.js runtime for the backend and Chromium for the frontend. Electron is the main GUI framework behind several notable open-source projects including GitHub’s Atom and Microsoft’s Visual Studio Code source code editors, the Tidal music streaming service desktop application and the Light Table IDE, in addition to the freeware desktop client for the Discord chat service. Each Electron app has two threads: one is the main thread (dealing with the App window and bootup), and one is the renderer thread (which is basically your web code UI). Renderer ThreadElectron uses Chromium for displaying web pages in a separate process called the render process. This thread deals with your UI code in /src folder. In normal browsers, web pages usually run in a sand-boxed environment and are not allowed access to native resources. For Electron users, however, you got the power to use Node.js APIs in web pages allowing lower level operating system interactions. Main ThreadIn Electron, the process that runs package.json’s main script is called the main process. The script that runs in the main process and can display a GUI by initializing the renderer thread."},{"title":"Electron Packages","updated":"2018-02-21T21:16:36.675Z","permalink":"http://quasar-framework.org/guide/electron-packages.html","text":"You can npm install and use Electron specific packages in your app. Take a look at the link and choose wisely if you need to."},{"title":"Electron Preparation","updated":"2018-02-21T21:16:36.675Z","permalink":"http://quasar-framework.org/guide/electron-preparation.html","text":"Before we dive in to the actual development, we need to do some preparation work. 1. Add Quasar Electron ModeIn order to develop/build a Quasar Electron app, we need to add the Electron mode to our Quasar project. What this does is that it npm installs some Electron packages and creates /src-electron folder.$ quasar mode -a electron Every Electron app has two threads: the main thread (deals with the window and initialization code – from the newly created folder /src-electron) and the renderer thread (which deals with the actual content of your app from /src). The new folder has the following structure:.└── src-electron/ ├── icons/ # Icons of your app for all platforms | ├── icon.icns # Icon file for Darwin (MacOS) platform | ├── icon.ico # Icon file for win32 (Windows) platform | └── linux-256x256.png # Icon file for Linux platform └── main-process/ # Main thread source code ├── electron-main.dev.js # Main thread code while developing; read below └── electron-main.js # Main thread code for production When you add the Quasar Electron mode, you’ll notice that a few npm packages are installed. These are Electron specific and since Electron doesn’t follow the semver notation, it’s best that you lock the installed versions. Otherwise, other developers working on the same project may end up using on different Electron version – room for trouble. Electron makes releases quite often so features are always subject to change. Electron-main.dev.jsThis file (/src-electron/main-process/electron-main.dev.js) is used specifically for development and is used to install dev-tools. Usually it should not have to be modified, but can be used to extend your development needs. After it sets up dev-tools it imports the electron-main.js which is the place you’ll make most (if not all) of your changes. A note for Windows UsersIf you run into errors during npm install about node-gyp, then you most likely do not have the proper build tools installed on your system. Build tools include items like Python and Visual Studio. Fortunately, there are a few packages to help simplify this process. The first item we need to check is our npm version and ensure that it is not outdated. This is accomplished using npm-windows-upgrade. If you are using yarn, then you can skip this check. Once that is complete, we can then continue to setup the needed build tools. Using windows-build-tools, most of the dirty work is done for us. Installing this globally will in turn setup Visual C++ packages, Python, and more. At this point things should successfully install, but if not then you will need a clean installation of Visual Studio. Please note that these are not problems with Quasar, but they are related to NPM and Windows. 2. Start DevelopingIf you want to jump right in and start developing, you can skip the previous step with “quasar mode” command and issue:$ quasar dev -m electron -t [mat|ios] This will add Electron mode automatically, if it is missing.It will open up an Electron window which will render your app along with Developer Tools opened side by side."},{"title":"Electron Static Assets","updated":"2018-02-21T21:16:36.675Z","permalink":"http://quasar-framework.org/guide/electron-static-assets.html","text":"Please read about Handling Assets first, which applies to the renderer process. However, when we deal with Electron then Quasar CLI offers a handy __static variable in addition. Statics can be consumed by both the main process and renderer process, but since the paths change when building for production (due to packaging), then usage with fs and other modules that need a full path can be a little tricky. So __statics can come into play. On the subject of using dirname &amp; filenameSince the main process is bundled using webpack, the use of __dirname and __filename will not provide an expected value in production. Referring to the File Tree, you’ll notice that in production the electron-main.js is placed inside the dist/electron-* folder. Based on this knowledge, use __dirname &amp; __filename accordingly. app.asar└─ dist └─ electron-* ├─ statics/ ├─ js/... ├─ node_modules/ ├─ index.html ├─ package.json └─ electron-main.js Static assets with fs, path and __staticsLet’s say we have a static asset that we need to read into our application using fs, but how do we get a reliable path, in both development and production, to the statics/ folder? Quasar provides a global variable named __statics that will yield a proper path to it. Here’s how we can use it to read a simple text file in both development and production. Let’s assume we have a file called someFile.txt in /src/statics. Now, in main or renderer process, we can access it like this:// main or renderer processimport fs from 'fs'import path from 'path'let fileContents = fs.readFileSync(path.join(__statics, '/someFile.txt'), 'utf8')"},{"title":"Troubleshoot and Tips","updated":"2018-02-21T21:16:36.676Z","permalink":"http://quasar-framework.org/guide/electron-troubleshoot-and-tips.html","text":"Read &amp; Write Local FilesOne great benefit of using Electron is the ability to access the user’s file system. This enables you to read and write files on the local system. To help avoid Chromium restrictions and writing to your application’s internal files, make sure to take use of electron’s APIs, specifically the app.getPath(name) function. This helper method can get you file paths to system directories such as the user’s desktop, system temporary files, etc. We can use the userData directory, which is reserved specifically for our application, so we can have confidence other programs or other user interactions should not tamper with this file space. import path from &apos;path&apos;import &#123; remote &#125; from &apos;electron&apos;const filePath = path.join(remote.app.getPath(&apos;userData&apos;), &apos;/some.file&apos;) Debugging Main ProcessWhen running your application in development you may have noticed a message from the main process mentioning a remote debugger.

Design an app in record time, using a state of the art CLI and backed by well-written, very fast Quasar web components. When using Quasar, you won’t need additional heavy libraries like Hammerjs, Momentjs or Bootstrap. It’s got that covered too, and with a small footprint! Why Quasar?Because of what is offered out of the box. Follow our Twitter account for testimonials. All Platforms in One GoOne source code for all platforms simultaneously: responsive desktop/mobile website, PWAs (Progressive Web Apps), mobile apps (that look native) and multi-platform desktop apps (through Electron). Top class, fast web responsive componentsThere’s a component for almost every web development need out there. Each of these components are carefully crafted to offer the best possible experience to users. Quasar is designed with performance &amp; responsiveness in mind – so the overhead of using Quasar is barely noticeable. This is an area we take special pride in. Best practices integrated by defaultDevelopers using Quasar are encouraged to follow web development best practices, and it comes with many embedded features to that regard out of the box. HTML/CSS/JS minification, cache busting, tree shaking, sourcemapping, code-splitting &amp; lazy loading, ES6 transpiling, linting code, accessibility features. Quasar takes care of all these and more - no configuration needed. Full RTL SupportRTL (right to left) support for both Quasar components &amp; developer’s own code. Developer-written website/app CSS code gets automatically converted to RTL if an RTL language pack is used. Two Themes (more to come)The framework supports two of the most commonly used themes out of the box – Material theme and iOS theme. Progressively migrate your existing projectQuasar offers an UMD (Unified Module Definition) version, which means developers can add a CSS and JS HTML tag into existing project and they’re ready to use it. No build step is required. Unparalleled developer experience through Quasar CLIWhen using Quasar’s CLI, developers benefit from: State preserving hot-reload when making changes to app source code, no matter if it’s a website, PWA, a Mobile App (directly on a phone or on an emulator) or an Electron app. Developers simply change their code and they can watch it get updated on the fly, without the need of any page refresh. State preserving compilation error overlay. Lint-on-save with ESLint – if developers like linting their code only ES6 code transpiling Sourcemaps Changing build options doesn’t require a manual reload of the dev server Many more leading-edge developer tools and techniques Get up to speed fastThe top-class starter kit makes it easy for developers to bring an idea to reality in record time. The heavy lifting is done for the developer, not by the developer. You are free to focus on your features instead and let the boilerplate be done by Quasar. Awesome ever-growing communityWhen developers encounter a problem they can’t solve, they can visit the Quasar forum or Discord chat server. The community is there to help you. Wide platform supportGoogle Chrome, Firefox, IE11/Edge, Safari, Opera, iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Blackberry. Quasar components Internationalization (I18n)I18n is provided by default for Quasar components. If your language pack is missing it takes just 5 minutes to add it. Great documentationFinally, it’s worth mentioning the significant amount of time that is spent on writing great, bloat-free, focused, complete documentation pages so that developers can quickly pick up Quasar. There will be no room for confusion. Underlying technologiesVue, Babel, Webpack, Cordova, Electron. Except for Vue, which takes half a day to pick up and will change you forever, you are not really required to know the other technologies. Most of them are integrated and already configured for you.

The difference between building a SPA, Mobile App, Electron App or a PWA is simply determined by the “mode” parameter in “quasar dev” and “quasar build” commands. InstallationIn order to build a PWA, we first need to add the PWA mode to our Quasar project:$ quasar mode -a pwa If you want to jump right in and start developing, you can skip the “quasar mode” command and issue:$ quasar dev -m pwa This will add PWA mode automatically, if it is missing. Service WorkerAdding PWA mode to a Quasar project means a new folder will be created: /src-pwa, which contains PWA specific files:.└── src-pwa/ ├── service-worker-dev.js # Development Service Worker └── service-worker-prod.js # Production Service Worker You can freely edit these files. Notice that the development uses a separate Service Worker than the production build. This service worker (/src-pwa/service-worker-dev.js) file is effectively a ‘no-op’ that will reset any previous service worker registered for the same host:port combination. In the production build, this file is replaced with an actual service worker file that will pre-cache your site’s local assets: /src-pwa/service-worker-prod.js. Configuring Manifest FileThe Manifest file is generated by Quasar CLI by using sw-precache-webpack-plugin package and a default configuration for it. You can however tweak this configuration from /quasar.conf.js. Example taken from Quasar Play’s quasar.conf.js:pwa: &#123; cacheId: '...' // default taken from package.json &gt; name field or 'quasar-pwa-app' cacheExt: 'js,html,css,ttf,eot,otf,woff,woff2,json,svg,gif,jpg,jpeg,png,wav,ogg,webm,flac,aac,mp4,mp3', manifest: &#123; name: 'Quasar Play', short_name: 'Quasar-Play', description: 'Quasar Framework Showcase', icons: [ &#123; 'src': 'statics/icons/icon-128x128.png', 'sizes': '128x128', 'type': 'image/png' &#125;, &#123; 'src': 'statics/icons/icon-192x192.png', 'sizes': '192x192', 'type': 'image/png' &#125;, &#123; 'src': 'statics/icons/icon-256x256.png', 'sizes': '256x256', 'type': 'image/png' &#125;, &#123; 'src': 'statics/icons/icon-384x384.png', 'sizes': '384x384', 'type': 'image/png' &#125;, &#123; 'src': 'statics/icons/icon-512x512.png', 'sizes': '512x512', 'type': 'image/png' &#125; ], display: 'standalone', orientation: 'portrait', background_color: '#ffffff', theme_color: '#027be3' &#125;&#125; Please read about the manifest config before diving in.

These apps meet certain requirements (see below), are deployed to web servers and accessible through URLs (on HTTPS protocol). This can work in conjunction with Cordova to provide a multiple deploy targets for all your users. Quasar CLI allows you to deploy your app as a PWA as well as a Mobile app and take advantage of both channels. What is RequiredTo be considered a Progressive Web App, your app must be: Progressive - Work for every user, regardless of browser choice, because they are built with progressive enhancement as a core tenet. Responsive - Fit any form factor, desktop, mobile, tablet, or whatever is next. Connectivity independent - Enhanced with service workers to work offline or on low quality networks. App-like - Use the app-shell model to provide app-style navigation and interactions. Fresh - Always up-to-date thanks to the service worker update process. Safe - Served via HTTPS to prevent snooping and ensure content has not been tampered with. Discoverable - Are identifiable as “applications” thanks to W3C manifests and service worker registration scope allowing search engines to find them. Re-engageable - Make re-engagement easy through features like push notifications. Installable - Allow users to “keep” apps they find most useful on their home screen without the hassle of an app store. Linkable - Easily share via URL and not require complex installation. More information available on Addy Osmani’s article about PWA. Manifest FileAn app manifest file describes the resources your app will need. This includes your app’s displayed name, icons, as well as splash screen. Quasar CLI configures this for you, but you can override any property from within /quasar.conf.js. Learn how by visiting the Configure PWA documentation page. More information on the Manifest file can be read by accessing:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest Service WorkerThe Service worker provides a programmatic way to cache app resources. Be it JavaScript files or JSON data from a HTTPS request. The programmatic API allows developers to decide how to handle caching and provides a much more flexible experience than other options. More information on the Service Worker API can be read by accessing:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API NOTEA full-blown Service Worker is not available during development due to the fact that it is not compatible with HMR (Hot Module Reload). So, as opposed to production code, development has a very simple Service Worker that just invalidates cache. Take a look at /src-pwa for the two service workers used. You can change these files to meet your needs."},{"title":"Quasar CLI","updated":"2018-03-03T16:04:29.503Z","permalink":"http://quasar-framework.org/guide/quasar-cli.html","text":"The Quasar CLI allows you to create new projects in no time, by generating a base application, filled with everything you need to begin working on your application. It does most of the heavy-lifting, so you need not concern yourself with the redundant tasks of building the application. You only need Quasar CLI if using the Main Starter Kit. If you want the UMD version, you won’t be using it. # Node.js &gt;= 8.9.0 is required.$ npm install -g quasar-cli Familiarize yourself with the list of commands:$ quasar ...

In order for you to see what versions of Node, NPM, Quasar CLI, Quasar, Vue, Webpack, Cordova, Babel and many more, issue this command in a Quasar project folder:$ quasar info dev (Development Server)$ quasar dev -h Description Starts the app in development mode (hot-code reloading, error reporting, etc) Usage $ quasar dev -p &lt;port number&gt; Options --theme, -t App theme (default: mat) --mode, -m App mode [spa|pwa|cordova|electron] (default: spa) --port, -p A port number on which to start the application --hostname, -H A hostname to use for serving the application --help, -h Displays this message Only for Cordova mode: --target, -T (required) App target [android|ios|blackberry10|browser|osx|ubuntu|webos|windows] --emulator, -e (optional) Emulator name Example: iPhone-7, iPhone-X The Quasar development server allows you to develop your App by compiling and maintaining code in-memory. A web server will serve your App while offering hot-reload out of the box. Running in-memory offers faster rebuilds when you change your code. Hot Reload is much more than just refreshing your browser when code changes. It skips the refresh and updates your code on the fly, while maintaining your App’s state (like your Vue’s model data). Please note that there are cases when this is impossible, so the dev webserver will simply refresh your browser. (Always ensure you are running only one instance of Quasar CLI at a time, otherwise Hot-Reload and other stuff will break!) Based on what you want to develop, you can start the development server by using “quasar dev” command as follows: # Developing a SPA$ quasar dev# ...or$ quasar dev -m spa# Developing a PWA$ quasar dev -m pwa# Developing a Mobile App (through Cordova)$ quasar dev -m cordova -T [android|ios]# Developing an Electron App$ quasar dev -m electron However, there are two themes available: Material Design (‘mat’) and iOS (‘ios’). In order for specifying a specific theme, add the ‘-t’ parameter to the above commands: # Material Design$ quasar dev -t mat# iOS theme$ quasar dev -t ios If you wish to change the hostname or port serving your App you have 3 options: Edit ‘/quasar.conf.js’: devServer: &#123; host: '...', port: ...&#125; Through ‘-H’ (hostname) and ‘-p’ (port) command options. If this is a one time thing, specify the hostname and/or port as an environment variable:$ PORT=3000 quasar dev$ HOSTNAME=1.1.1.14 quasar dev If there appears to be an issue with hot reload, you can try two fixes: Change the permissions for the project folder with sudo chown -R username: . or run the dev server with root privileges sudo quasar dev build / clean (Build App for Production)$ quasar build -h Description Builds distributables of your app. Usage $ quasar build -p &lt;port number&gt; Options --theme, -t App theme (default: mat) --mode, -m App mode [spa|pwa|cordova|electron] (default: spa) --target, -T App target - Cordova (default: all installed) [android|ios|blackberry10|browser|osx|ubuntu|webos|windows] - Electron (default: yours) [darwin|win32|linux|mas|all] --debug, -d Build for debugging purposes --clean, -c Clean build artifact first --help, -h Displays this message ONLY for Electron mode: --arch, -A App architecture (default: yours) [ia32|x64|armv7l|arm64|all] The Quasar CLI can pack everything together and optimize your App for production.

When you develop for PWA, Cordova or Electron, you need these modes installed. If you issue “quasar dev” or “quasar build” they will automatically be installed. These modes will add a “src-*” folder into your project with very specific code for it: Folder Mode Description src-pwa pwa Contains the Service Worker file that you can tweak. src-cordova cordova Is a Cordova project folder that will be using your ‘src’ as content. Tweak Cordova config, add/remove platforms, splash screens, Cordova plugins and so on from this folder. Do NOT touch “src-cordova/www” folder though as it will get overwritten at every build. src-electron electron Has code for the main Electron thread. The renderer thread will be your app in ‘src’. If for some reason you decide you don’t need a mode, you can remove it. This will delete the respective “src-*” folder.$ quasar mode --remove pwa serve (Serve Static-Content Folder)$ quasar serve -h Description Create an ad-hoc http(s) server on a specified folder. This command has been deprecated in favor of using the \"http-server\" NPM package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server Install it by typing: \"npm install -g http-server\" Check its usage by visiting the link above. Basic usage is: $ http-server [path] [options] When building a SPA or PWA, the distributable folder can be served by any static webserver. To test it out (assuming you don’t have a specific publicPath or not using Vue Router “history” mode), you can use the “http-server” npm package. Or you can build your own server. Here are some examples:// when using default Vue Router \"hash\" modeconst express = require('express'), serveStatic = require('serve-static'), port = process.env.PORT || 5000const app = express()app.use(serveStatic(...path-to-dist...))app.listen(port) // when using Vue Router \"history\" modeconst express = require('express'), serveStatic = require('serve-static'), history = require('connect-history-api-fallback'), port = process.env.PORT || 5000const app = express()app.use(history())app.use(serveStatic(...path-to-dist...))app.listen(port) If you need URL rewrites of API, or simply put you want to proxy your API requests, then you can use “http-proxy-middleware” package:// add this to one of the two previous examples:const proxy = require('http-proxy-middleware')// ...app.use('/api', proxy(&#123; '/api': &#123; target: `http://my-api.com:5050`, pathRewrite: &#123;\"^/api\" : \"\"&#125; &#125;&#125;))// then app.listen(...)

Then we’ll go on to discuss how you can migrate your pre v0.15 project. Upgrading to a newer Quasar versionThis applies when upgrading from v0.15 to a newer v0.15 or a next major Quasar version. IMPORTANTQuasar v0.15+ requires Node.js version 8.9.0 or greater UMDSimply replace the version string in all the CSS and JS tags that refer to Quasar to the newer version. Starter KitAs you may have noticed, the only dependency in your project (unless you’ve also installed a linter or your own deps) is quasar-cli. All you need is to update this dependency. $ npm install quasar-cli@latest Quasar CLI is installed both globally and locally. When you issue a Quasar command, the global installation defers to the project locally installed Quasar CLI. This allows you to skip writing npm scripts in your package.json (for Quasar commands), and also it allows you to run different Quasar versions in multiple projects. Watch for Quasar CLI version. It’s not the same thing as Quasar version. Type $ quasar info. All you need to know is that the major and minor part of Quasar CLI version matches Quasar version. So for example installing latest Quasar CLI v0.15.x will ensure you are using latest Quasar v0.15.x. While working on v0.15.x, no breaking changes will occur, so you are safe (&amp; recommended) to upgrade to latest Quasar CLI as it’s released. CaveatSometimes after you npm install a package, or even update current packages, NPM might screw things up. You’ll get errors that some packages are missing and you need to install them. In such cases, delete node_modules and package-lock.json and npm install again. Upgrading to Quasar v0.15There’s been A LOT of work done for v0.15. The Quasar CLI has been rewritten from scratch to allow for a stellar development experience (Mobile App developers and Electron will fall in love with it!). Only one starter kit is required in order to handle websites, PWAs, Mobile Apps and Electron Apps. Building any of those is a matter of just adding a parameter to the dev/build command. Furthermore, you can now use an UMD/standalone version of Quasar to embed in an existing project. No build step is required. Take some time to read all “Guide” pages once again. It will help you understand the true power of Quasar v0.15 and what you can do with it. So, what is new and what has changed? Everything has been polished. The full list of enhancements and new features is exhausting. We’ll try to cover the major parts only. This is just a guide to get you started so that you know where to look in docs for things that have changed. First step - when using starter kitOk, so you’ve globally installed/updated “quasar-cli” to latest v0.15.x. Now it’s time for you to create a new project folder:# Node.js &gt;= 8.9.0 is required.$ npm install -g quasar-cli# Then we create a project folder with Quasar CLI:$ quasar init &lt;folder_name&gt; Observe the new project structure. Start to port out files to the new project folder, taking into account the far superior structure. Using the new starter kit will allow you to take advantage of future seamless upgrades! In any case, do not simply copy your /src folder over to the new starter kit. Build configuration no longer requiredYou’ll notice the new starter kit doesn’t provide a /build or /config folders. They are no longer required. Everything can be easily configured from /quasar.conf.js now. You don’t need to know Webpack. More Info. No main.js?Yes. It’s no longer there because you don’t need it anymore. For initialization code and importing libraries into your website/app, read about App Plugins. Importing Components/Directives/etcYou’re no longer required to import Quasar components and directives anywhere in your app. Simply configuring /quasar.conf.js in framework Object will suffice. More Info. Quasar Plugins?Yes, this refers to Action Sheet, Notify (replacement of Toast and Alert), LocalStorage/SessionStorage and so on. They are available globally or under the Vue $q Object injection, and need to be specified in /quasar.conf.js &gt; framework &gt; plugins in order for them to be available. Revamps Typography Flex CSS gutter classes QLayout &amp; co. You’ll love the new features! Be sure to check this out. Major improvements in syntax and flexibility. Some breaking changes, like slots no longer being used. QBtn (new features!) QToolbar (small update regarding buttons) QBreadcrumbs (powerful component instead of just CSS) QPagination (major improvements) QCollapsible (new powerful features!) QTable (replacing QDataTable – full customization now!) Lists &amp; List Items – more options, better control, “dark” theme QTree (the most advanced you’ll ever see and need!) ActionSheet (now as a Quasar Plugin &amp; QActionSheet component too! – has new features too) Dialog (now as a Quasar Plugin &amp; QDialog component too for unlimited flexibility! – has new features too) QModal - Easier to use than ever! Now with full v-model support. QPopover &amp; QTooltip - new animation, ability to close it without the need of a Vue reference (through v-close-overlay directive), full support for v-model now Loading (now as a Quasar Plugin) QCarousel - Easier to use. Fully customizable! Transitions - No need for QTransition anymore! Minimum overhead, better performance. QAlert - new features QChat - new features TouchSwipe, TouchHold and TouchPan - Much better implementation, more control. Read about these directive’s modifiers. AppFullscreen &amp; AppVisibility - Now as Quasar Plugins, with reactive state properties that can be used in Vue watchers QUploader - new features &amp; design Also notice QInlineDatetime has been renamed to QDatetimePicker. New Components or Features Spacing CSS classes QTable - It’s on the Revamps list too, but it sure deserves a place here too. Prepare for next level Data Tables, now fully customizable! Check out the demo too. QEditor - Quasar’s own WYSIWYG approach! This alone would deserve its own section. Notify - A merge between Toast and Alert, with flexible positioning and awesome animations. QColor - Color Picker! New button types: QBtnGroup and QBtnDropdown QBtnToggle - A radio-like component, but with buttons I18n for Quasar ComponentsBe sure to check out the Internationalization for Quasar Components. Icon PacksYou can now tell Quasar to use one of Fontawesome, Ionicons, MDI or Material Icons for its components. You are no longer required to include Material Icons. You can use any of these packs as default. Also, small change for Fontawesome icons:&lt;!-- pre v0.15 --&gt;&lt;q-icon name=\"fa-paypal fab\" /&gt;&lt;!-- v0.15+ --&gt;&lt;!-- Copy paste fontawesome icon class as it's in fontawesome docs now --&gt;&lt;q-icon name=\"fab fa-paypal\" /&gt; Vue Prototype InjectionsYou can use $q injection for convenience, accessing Quasar Theme, Quasar I18n, Quasar Platform, and many more. Quasar Plugins add functionality to it. Read doc page, especially if you build Cordova or Electron apps. What has been dropped? Global Event Bus (Events) – no longer needed. Use Vue root component events instead. More Info QFixedPosition – now replaced by a more powerful QPageSticky QSideLink – no longer required! Simply use a QItem or whatever component you want and bind an @click=&quot;$router.push(...)&quot; to it. Alert and Toast as methods. They’ve been merged into Notify. HTML Table. You can however check code from v0.14 and embed it yourself into your app. Image Gallery - no longer needed. The new QCarousel is so powerful that you’ll immediately see the benefit of switching to it. QTransition - no longer required. Simply use Vue’s &lt;transition&gt; (or &lt;transition-group&gt;) instead. More Info QDatetimeRange - it’s so easy to simply write two QDatetime side by side that this component is simply not required anymore; this allows you full flexibility too.

Notice that in order for us to place navigation tabs on header (for Material) and on Footer (for iOS), we also write a NavTabs component. Notice no slots, no QSideLink, “flat round dense” buttons, v-model on left/right drawers, QLayout* components:&lt;!-- layout component --&gt;&lt;q-layout ref=\"layout\" view=\"hHr LpR lFf\"&gt; &lt;!-- Header --&gt; &lt;q-layout-header&gt; &lt;q-toolbar&gt; &lt;q-btn flat round dense icon=\"menu\" @click=\"leftSide = !leftSide\" /&gt; &lt;q-toolbar-title&gt; Layout Header &lt;span slot=\"subtitle\"&gt;Optional subtitle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/q-toolbar-title&gt; &lt;q-btn flat round dense icon=\"menu\" @click=\"rightSide = !rightSide\" /&gt; &lt;/q-toolbar&gt; &lt;!-- Navigation for Material theme --&gt; &lt;nav-tabs v-if=\"$q.theme === 'mat'\" /&gt; &lt;/q-layout-header&gt; &lt;!-- Left Side Panel --&gt; &lt;q-layout-drawer v-model=\"leftSide\" side=\"left\"&gt; &lt;q-list no-border link inset-separator&gt; &lt;q-list-header&gt;Essential Links&lt;/q-list-header&gt; &lt;q-item to=\"/docs\"&gt; &lt;q-item-side icon=\"school\" /&gt; &lt;q-item-main label=\"Docs\" sublabel=\"quasar-framework.org\" /&gt; &lt;/q-item&gt; &lt;/q-list&gt; &lt;/q-layout-drawer&gt; &lt;!-- Right Side Panel --&gt; &lt;q-layout-drawer v-model=\"rightSide\" side=\"right\" :breakpoint=\"1100\"&gt; Right Side of Layout &lt;/q-layout-drawer&gt; &lt;!-- sub-routes get injected here: --&gt; &lt;q-page-container&gt; &lt;router-view /&gt; &lt;/q-page-container&gt; &lt;!-- Footer --&gt; &lt;q-layout-footer&gt; &lt;!-- Navigation for iOS theme --&gt; &lt;nav-tabs v-if=\"$q.theme === 'ios'\" /&gt; ... &lt;/q-layout-footer&gt;&lt;/q-layout&gt;&lt;!-- nav-tabs component --&gt;&lt;q-tabs&gt; &lt;q-route-tab slot=\"title\" icon=\"view_quilt\" to=\"/test-layout/about\" replace hide=\"icon\" label=\"About\" /&gt; &lt;q-route-tab slot=\"title\" icon=\"view_day\" to=\"/test-layout/toolbar\" replace hide=\"icon\" label=\"Toolbar\" /&gt; &lt;q-route-tab slot=\"title\" icon=\"view_day\" to=\"/test-layout/tabs\" replace label=\"Tabs\" /&gt; &lt;q-route-tab slot=\"title\" icon=\"input\" to=\"/test-layout/drawer\" replace label=\"Drawer\" /&gt;&lt;/q-tabs&gt; Form ComponentsIn previous versions you would listen for @change event to detect changes. Now you can listen to @input for immediate changes or @change for lazy update. Vue v-model.lazy support is a pending change, so until then you can use the equivalent form (details below). &lt;!-- QInput example --&gt;&lt;!-- same as listening for @input --&gt;&lt;q-input v-model=\"myModel\" /&gt;&lt;!-- listening for lazy update --&gt;&lt;q-input :value=\"myModel\" @change=\"val =&gt; &#123; myModel = val &#125;\" /&gt; You’ll notice all form components have been polished. Also, you’ll be pleasantly surprised by new properties. To name just a few: “hide-underline”, “inverted-light”, “dark” or “warning” (for highlighting a warning state). Prior to v0.15, form components had a default margin. This was removed to allow easier customization. You can now use the new Spacing CSS classes to do it. QCheckbox now supports an indeterminate state as well. You can specify a value for “true”/“false”/“indeterminate” states, so it no longer operates with Booleans (or Arrays) only. QDatetime now doesn’t require the “Set” button when using Popovers. Clicking on a date will simply select it and close the popover. QChipsInput (&amp; QChips) have new props that allow for better customization now. Using PromisesModals, Popovers, Tooltips, Layout Drawer, Dialog, Notify (just to name a few) now use Promises instead of taking a callback parameter. This allows you to take advantage of async/await and simplifies your code. methods: &#123; async showNotify () &#123; await this.$q.dialog('Some dialog...') console.log('Dialog has been closed') &#125;&#125; Vue refs no longer necessary for a lot of componentsYou were also used to using Vue refs for a few components (Layout left/right drawer, Modals, …). This is no longer necessary. You can use a “v-model” instead to show (open) / hide (close) them. This wasn’t quite possible pre v0.15 because you needed for them to close in order to, as an example, navigate away. Now it’s no longer needed, so a Boolean scoped variable will suffice. Some components need .native modifier for events nowSome components, like QItem or QCard &amp; co now need the .native modifier for binding to native DOM events like click. A general rule is: if @click is not mentioned in the component’s docs Vue Events section, then you need to use the native modifier. &lt;!-- prior to v0.15 --&gt;&lt;q-item @click=\"...\"&gt;....&lt;/q-item&gt;&lt;!-- v0.15 way: --&gt;&lt;q-item @click.native=\"...\"&gt;...&lt;/q-item&gt; A few Quasar components were of functional type. These pass native events right through, so there’s no need to add the native modifier. But during a thorough benchmarking session it turned out having these as regular components meant better performance due to a number of reasons. Switching these components from functional to regular adds this small breaking change where you need to use the native modifier. We were using different env for dev and productionYou still can! Only now it’s even better, due to /quasar.conf.js features. More Info New directive: v-close-overlayAll components using popups, like Modal, Dialog, Popover, Context Menu, now support a much simplified way of closing them. Instead of using a Vue reference, which is troublesome for some use cases, you can simply add v-close-overlay to the element/component that you wish to close the popup. This directive listens for the @click event, determines the first parent popup component and closes it. &lt;q-btn label=\"I got a Popover\"&gt; &lt;q-popover&gt; ... &lt;q-icon v-close-overlay name=\"close\" /&gt; ... &lt;/q-popover&gt;&lt;/q-btn&gt; Handling Back ButtonUnfortunately, the automatic handling of back button was a top feature hard to comprehend. It required you to handle Vue references (which beginners on Vue were struggling with) and didn’t fully allow you to connect components like Drawers &amp; Modals to Vuex in an easy way. Now it only works on Mobile Apps (for example Android has a back button that is handled by Quasar). The removal of this feature for websites greatly simplify your code: &lt;q-modal v-model=\"modal\"&gt;...&lt;/q-modal&gt;&lt;q-btn label=\"Open modal\" @click=\"modal = true\" /&gt; ButtonsWhile QBtn still allows you to specify icon and label as children nodes, it is now recommended that you use the “icon” and “label” props instead: &lt;q-btn icon=\"map\" label=\"See map\" /&gt;&lt;!-- instead of old: --&gt;&lt;q-btn&gt; &lt;q-icon class=\"on-left\" name=\"map\" /&gt; See map&lt;/q-btn&gt; Be sure to check out the new button types and props too. Quasar CLI and Pre-0.15 AppsThe Quasar CLI v0.15+ is not compatible with pre-0.15 apps. You can install the latest CLI globally while still supporting quasar commands in legacy apps by adding quasar-cli as a development dependency. To support 0.14 and earlier you need quasar-cli v0.6.5. $ npm install --save-dev quasar-cli@0.6.5 This will add the legacy quasar CLI tool to your projects ./node_modules/.bin/ directory. Use the npx tool (automatically installed alongside npm) to run quasar from your local node modules. For example: $ npx quasar dev"},{"title":"Quasar Theming","updated":"2018-02-21T21:16:36.681Z","permalink":"http://quasar-framework.org/guide/quasar-theming.html","text":"Every website/app needs a specific design to differentiate from the competition. This is where Quasar Framework excels, because: It offers two themes out of the box: Material and iOS The two themes can be customized/extended easily from the App code. You can change the primary color, the secondary color, and most of the CSS. Customizing does not mean having multiple CSS files, one overriding properties from the other. No. You’ll have one stylesheet with each CSS property declared only once. All themes include a CSS reset (following latest standards) to eliminate quirks between platforms. Quasar CSS is a blank slate that you can easily customize and modify to fit your brand, while still following the standards of each platform. The best apps in the app stores are fully customized and Quasar makes it easy to do the same with your App. Quasar is built on top of Stylus, which allows it to set some default styles for your App but makes it extremely easy for you to change the defaults in your App code. Customizing a theme means overriding Stylus variables which can hold colors, sizes, border types and so on. After reading this intro you can go to Components &gt; Stylus Variables for a list of all Stylus variables that you can override so you can theme your App. Please note the following: When building your App or starting the dev server you can only use one theme at a time. Quasar themes can be configured in /src/css/themes folder, which contains three files, as you’ll see in the next section. Structuresrc/css/themes folder from a Quasar App will contain the following files: src└── css └── themes ├── common.variables.styl # Theme Shared Quasar Variables ├── variables.mat.styl # Quasar Variables that apply to Material only └── variables.ios.styl # Quasar Variables that apply to iOS only You will find more documentation and steps in these files. Using Stylus variables in Vue filesIn your app’s *.vue files you can use the core Quasar Stylus variables (examples - colors: $primary, $red-1, media breakpoints: $breakpoint-md, $breakpoint-md-min and so on). &lt;!-- Notice lang=\"stylus\" --&gt;&lt;style lang=\"stylus\"&gt;// \"variables\" is a Webpack alias (provided out of the box by Quasar CLI)@import '~variables'div color $red-1 background-color $grey-5&lt;/style&gt; NOTE: You must add @import &#39;~variables&#39; within your &lt;style&gt; tags, in order for Quasar to parse any Stylus variables you may add. If you don’t, Quasar will literally pass the variables as text and any theming changes using Stylus variables won’t work. NOTE: The &lt;style&gt; tag uses Stylus code. You can’t use any other CSS pre-processor. Theming Your AppYou can easily theme your App by adding Stylus variable declarations in src/css/themes/common.variables.styl or the other two files (in the latter case if you want different looks for each Quasar theme). To customize the look and feel of this app, you can override the Stylus variables found in Quasar’s source Stylus files. Setting variables before Quasar’s Stylus will use these variables rather than Quasar’s default Stylus variable values. Stylus variables specific to the themes belong in either the variables.ios.styl or variables.mat.styl files. For example, change the primary color of your App: $primary = #00ffff Platform Specific StylesThe platform in which your App runs is automatically detected and the &lt;body&gt; tag gets following classes: Body Class Name Description mat Default style; Material Design theme; Android platform ios Apple platform; iOS theme desktop App runs on a desktop browser mobile App runs on a mobile browser cordova Standalone Mobile App wrapped with Apache Cordova electron App runs under Electron touch Touch capable platform no-touch Touch capability not present within-iframe For when entire website is under an IFRAME tag So you can write specific Stylus code for your App like this: body &amp;.cordova .tag color $primary &amp;.desktop .tag color $secondary &amp;.mobile .tag color $tertiary Stylus VariablesRead a complete list of all Stylus variables that you can override."},{"title":"Action Sheet","updated":"2018-02-21T21:16:36.617Z","permalink":"http://quasar-framework.org/components/action-sheet.html","text":"Action Sheets slide up from the bottom edge of the device screen, and display a set of options with the ability to confirm or cancel an action. Action Sheets can sometimes be used as an alternative to menus, however, they should not be used for navigation. The Action Sheet always appears above any other components on the page, and must be dismissed in order to interact with the underlying content. When it is triggered, the rest of the page darkens to give more focus to the Action Sheet options. Action Sheets can be displayed as a list or as a grid, with icons or with avatars. They can be used either as a component in your Vue file templates, or as a globally available method. Basic Usage as a MethodFirst, we install it: Edit /quasar.conf.js:framework: &#123; plugins: ['ActionSheet']&#125; Now let’s see how we can use it:// outside of a Vue fileimport &#123; ActionSheet &#125; from 'quasar'(Promise) ActionSheet.create(configObj)// inside of a Vue file(Promise) this.$q.actionSheet(configObj) Basic syntax for the config object:this.$q.actionSheet(&#123; title: 'Article Actions', // specify ONLY IF you want grid mode: grid: true, // optional; change dismiss label (only for iOS theme) dismissLabel: 'Quit', actions: [ &#123; label: 'Delete', // Optional color: 'negative', // Choose one of the following two: icon: 'delete', // specify ONLY IF using icon avatar: 'assets/some-avatar.png', // specify ONLY IF using avatar // optional; what to do when user chooses this action; // Can also be handled later by using the returned Promise // and identifying the action from \"action\" param handler () &#123; console.log('Deleted Article') &#125; &#125;, &#123;&#125;, // optional separator ... ]&#125;) IMPORTANTWhen user hits the phone/tablet back button (only for Cordova apps), the Action Sheet will get closed automatically.Also, when on a desktop browser, hitting the &lt;ESCAPE&gt; key also closes the Action Sheet. Handling OutcomeThe returning object when creating an ActionSheet is a Promise, so you can leverage the Promise API to handle the outcome: this.$q.actionSheet(&#123;...&#125;) .then(action =&gt; &#123; // user picked an action console.log(action) // &#123; label: 'Joe', ... &#125; &#125;) .catch(() =&gt; &#123; // user dismissed Action Sheet &#125;)// OR with async/await:async showActionSheet () &#123; try &#123; const action = await this.$q.actionSheet(&#123;...&#125;) // user picked an action at this point console.log(action) // &#123; label: 'Joe', ... &#125; &#125; catch () &#123; // user dismissed Action Sheet &#125;&#125; Basic Usage As a ComponentFirst, we install it: Edit /quasar.conf.js:framework: &#123; components: ['QActionSheet']&#125; Now let’s see how we can use it:&lt;template&gt; &lt;q-action-sheet v-model=\"actionSheet\" title=\"Action Sheet\" @ok=\"onOk\" @cancel=\"onCancel\" @show=\"onShow\" @hide=\"onHide\" :actions=\"[ &#123; label: 'Delete', icon: 'delete', color: 'red', handler: deleteAction &#125;, &#123; label: 'Share', icon: 'share', color: 'primary' &#125;, // optional separator &#123;&#125;, // continuing with other actions &#123; label: 'Play', icon: 'gamepad' &#125;, &#123; label: 'Favorite', icon: 'favorite' &#125; ]\" /&gt; &lt;!-- there's an optional \"title\" slot if you have something very specific for the ActionSheet title (it replaces \"title\" prop) --&gt;&lt;/template&gt;&lt;script&gt;export default &#123; data () &#123; // model for QActionSheet example return &#123; actionSheet: false &#125; &#125;, methods: &#123; // custom handler for one of the actions deleteAction () &#123; // @ok event will still be triggered this.$q.notify('Deleting...') &#125;, // user picked one of the actions onOk (item) &#123; if (item.handler) &#123; // if we've already triggered a handler return &#125; this.$q.notify(&#123; color: 'secondary', message: `Clicked on \"$&#123;item.label&#125;\"` &#125;) &#125;, // user dismissed ActionSheet onCancel () &#123; this.$q.notify(&#123; color: 'tertiary', icon: 'done', message: 'Action Sheet was dismissed' &#125;) &#125;, // when we show it to the user onShow () &#123; &#125;, // when it gets hidden onHide () &#123; &#125; &#125;&#125;&lt;/script&gt; QActionSheet Vue Properties Vue Property Type Required Description actions Array of Objects yes Defining ActionSheet actions title String Title of Action Sheet. grid Boolean Makes it a “tag” type. dismiss-label String Override default i18n “Cancel” label (for iOS theme only) QActionSheet Vue Events Vue Property Description @ok(action) User picked an action. @cancel User dismissed ActionSheet. @show ActionSheet has just been showed to the user. @hide ActionSheet has been hidden (regardless of outcome). @escape-key ActionSheet dismissed with ESCAPE key."},{"title":"Mobile Addressbar Coloring","updated":"2018-03-13T19:49:52.330Z","permalink":"http://quasar-framework.org/components/addressbar-color.html","text":"Newer mobile browsers have the ability to specify a color for the addressbar, like in the example below.

Quasar also follows this practice and distributes all its components encapsulated. This guide should help you to build new components by either using existing Quasar components or starting from scratch. Before you read this guide, please make sure you understand the concepts behind Vue components and also read up on Single File Components. Using existing componentsQuasar is a framework and therefore provides building blocks to build your own apps on top of it. But often the question arises how one could use the already existing Quasar components to build own components. The first thing to notice is that Vue favors composition over inheritance. Inheritance is a concept know from object oriented programming, where classes are able to extend another class to reuse its methods and attributes to build a new but similar class. Composition, on the other hand, is also known from object oriented programming, but instead of extending or overwriting an existing class, the class uses other classes to provide some common services. Compose components to build a new oneMost of the times you want to take existing Quasar components and build new components on top of them.You can refer to this as the Decorator pattern / Wrapper known from object oriented programming. This pattern allows to create new versions of an object and altering/extending its behavior by wrapping the existing object and giving it a new name, therefore not affecting the base object. Let’s take a look at a simple example: Custom select componentLet’s assume we want to build a component that hides some of the props passed to QSelect. Specifically, we want to build a select component which always has the filter prop set to true and always apply a default filter-placeholder. A simple implementation of this component could look like this: &lt;template&gt; &lt;q-select :value=&quot;value&quot; :options=&quot;options&quot; @change=&quot;handleChange&quot; filter filter-placeholder=&quot;select&quot;/&gt;&lt;/template&gt;&lt;script&gt; import &#123; QSelect &#125; from &apos;quasar&apos; export default &#123; props: [&apos;value&apos;, &apos;options&apos;], methods: &#123; handleChange (newVal) &#123; this.$emit(&apos;input&apos;, newVal) &#125; &#125;, components: &#123; QSelect &#125; &#125;&lt;/script&gt; Because v-model=&quot;foo&quot; is just syntactic sugar for :value=&quot;foo&quot; @input=&quot;foo = $event.target.the value&quot; we can define a property value on our new component, which is then passed as value to the inner QSelect. Then we can listen to the change event on the QSelect to trigger a method when the input has changed. If we receive such an event, we are emitting an input event from our new component and pass the new value as a parameter, so it can again be used with vmodel. Now we can use the component like this: &lt;template&gt; &lt;my-select v-model=&quot;selected&quot; :options=&quot;myOptions&quot; /&gt;&lt;/template&gt;&lt;script&gt; import MySelect from &apos;./MySelect&apos; export default &#123; data () &#123; return &#123; selected: null, myOptions: [] &#125; &#125;, components: &#123; MySelect &#125; &#125;&lt;/script&gt; This would render a QSelect with filter set to true and filter-placeholder set to “select”. A great way to inspect this is by using vue-devtools Note that we now can not use all the standard QSelect properties. If we wanted to set other properties on the internal QSelect we would have to define all of them on our own component and pass them to QSelect. Pinpad componentNow let’s assume we do not want to wrap an existing component to simply it, but instead, we want to build an entirely new component which is not included with Quasar. This example is taken from a forum post, where a user wanted to build a pin pad component. If you think about pin pads for a minute, you will quickly come to the conclusion that pin pads most of the time are made up of a matrix of buttons. That’s great, we already have the existing QBtn component included with Quasar, so these could be used to build our pin pad component. Next thing we need for a pin pad is to order a set of buttons in a matrix. For this the CSS flexbox layout is great. Gladly Quasar also has you covered here and already includes a flexbox grid. If we throw this two thing together, building our pin pad is easy. &lt;template&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div v-for=&quot;row in 3&quot; class=&quot;row justify-center&quot;&gt; &lt;div v-for=&quot;col in 3&quot; class=&quot;col-auto&quot;&gt; &lt;q-btn @click=&quot;handleClick((row-1)*3 + col)&quot;&gt; &#123;&#123; (row-1)*3 + col &#125;&#125; &lt;/q-btn&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/template&gt;&lt;script&gt; import &#123; QBtn &#125; from &apos;quasar&apos; export default &#123; data () &#123; return &#123; pin: &apos;&apos; &#125; &#125;, methods: &#123; handleClick (digit) &#123; this.pin += digit &#125; &#125;, components: &#123; QBtn &#125; &#125;&lt;/script&gt; This gives us a whole new component by using existing components. We could now even extend this component with other Quasar components like a QInput to allow for manually entered pins. Of course, this is just a minimal example, we miss styling of the buttons and all the logic that goes behind a pin pad. MixinsMixins allow re-using certain features that you need in a set of components to not repeat yourself writing that code over and over. To define a mixin one has to export an object that looks similar to a normal component. Other components now can use this mixin to implement the mixin functionality. For example, lets we need to call a register method on a lot of different components. This method calls an API and returns some identifier that should be stored in the data object of the component. First, let us define the RegisterMixin: export const RegisterMixin = &#123; data () &#123; return &#123; id: '' &#125; &#125;, methods: &#123; register () &#123; // Lets assume we extracted the AJAX call to the Registration class new Registration() .register() .then(response =&gt; &#123; this.id = response.id &#125;) &#125; &#125;, created () &#123; this.register() &#125;&#125; Now that we have defined the mixin, we can use it on any other component and it will be mixed in the component attributes. import &#123; RegisterMixin &#125; from &apos;./registerMixin&apos;export default &#123; mixins: [RegisterMixin]&#125; A component can use as many mixins as it likes.But be aware how Vue merges the options. You can read more about mixins in the Vue docs. Quasar uses mixins for some of its internal functionality. For example, the RouterLinkMixin which allows adding link functionality to different components. But as great as mixins are, you can not really use another single file component as mixin because only the JavaScript parts are mixed into your component and not the template or style definition. Let’s assume we want to build the MySelect component from above, using mixins. If we would write the following code import &#123; QSelect &#125; from &apos;quasar&apos;export default &#123; mixin: [QSelect]&#125; we would end up with a component that has all the internal methods and data from QSelect but no template at all. So we would have to get to the source of QSelect and copy the whole template definition. This would work as long as QSelect gets updated and you forget to update the template as well. Even if you only update minor versions it could break, because you are not relying on the external interface of QSelect which is described in the docs, but also on the internal code, which normally one shouldn’t have to care about. So mixins are great to simplify your own components and if you want to build an entirely new component on top of existing Quasar logic. How to style custom componentsStyling custom components is easy, just declare your styles in the &lt;style&gt; section of your single file component or import a external style definition by using &lt;style src=&quot;/path/to/your/stlye&quot;&gt;&lt;/style&gt; But what if we want our styles to be consistent and be able to change them in a single place? Quasar uses Stylus variables for that purpose.If you want to use some of the variables in your own components you can just import them like so: &lt;template&gt; ...&lt;/template&gt;&lt;script&gt; ...&lt;/script&gt;&lt;style lang=&quot;stylus&quot;&gt; @import &apos;~variables&apos;&lt;/style&gt; Now you can use all the Stylus variables like colors or breakpoints in your own component. @import '~variables'h1 color $primary Inter-component communicationVue provides various ways to allow two or more components to communicate with each other. PropsProps are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component. Almost all Quasar components use props to allow you to pass data or set options on them. EventsFor more complex communication events are used. One particulary interesting thing about events is that v-model=&quot;foo&quot; is just syntactic sugar for :value=&quot;foo&quot; @input=&quot;foo = $event.target.the value&quot;. If you want to build a custom component you can use v-model on, just emit an input event with the payload somewhere in your code. DirectivesAnother form of reusable code in Vue are directives. Quasar provides a set of directives out of the box you can use. Swiping, Panning and HoldThe v-touch-pan, v-touch-swipe and v-touch-hold directives allow you to add gesture and touch interactions to your custom components. RippleThe Material Ripple directive allows you add the well know ripple effect to your custom components. UtilsIn addition to components and directives Quasar also offers a set of JavaScript Utils to simplify your component development, check them out in the Utils section."},{"title":"Button Group","updated":"2018-03-03T16:04:29.476Z","permalink":"http://quasar-framework.org/components/button-group.html","text":"You can conveniently group QBtn and QBtnDropdown using QBtnGroup.

More examplesWhen adding an icon to a regular button, there are two possibilities for its position. The default position is left. Use icon-right property instead to position the icon to the right: &lt;!-- icon will be placed on the left --&gt;&lt;q-btn icon=\"mail\" color=\"primary\" label=\"Button Label\" /&gt;&lt;!-- icon will be placed on the right --&gt;&lt;q-btn icon-right=\"mail\" color=\"teal\" label=\"Button Label\" /&gt;&lt;!-- icons will be placed on both sides --&gt;&lt;q-btn icon=\"mail\" icon-right=\"mail\" color=\"teal\" label=\"Button Label\" /&gt; Button SizesUse size attribute with one of the following values: xs, sm, md, lg, xl. You don’t need to specify md, because that’s the default size.&lt;q-btn color=\"primary\" size=\"xs\" label=\"Extra Small Button\" /&gt;&lt;q-btn color=\"primary\" size=\"sm\" label=\"Small Button\" /&gt;&lt;q-btn color=\"primary\" size=\"md\" label=\"Medium Button\" /&gt;&lt;q-btn color=\"primary\" size=\"lg\" label=\"Large Button\" /&gt;&lt;q-btn color=\"primary\" size=\"xl\" label=\"Extra Large Button\" /&gt; You can also use a CSS unit as size:&lt;q-btn color=\"primary\" size=\"25px\" label=\"25 Pixels\" /&gt;&lt;q-btn color=\"primary\" size=\"2rem\" label=\"2 Rem\" /&gt;&lt;q-btn color=\"primary\" size=\"3vh\" label=\"3 View Height\" /&gt; You can also make use of globally available CSS helper class block (sets CSS display property to block) or full-width to expand the button. Button ColorsUse any color from the Quasar Color Palette. Examples: primary, orange, lime, ‘amber-8’. &lt;q-btn color=\"primary\" label=\"Primary Button\"/&gt;&lt;q-btn color=\"amber\" label=\"Amber Button\"/&gt;&lt;q-btn color=\"primary\" text-color=\"amber\" label=\"Primary Button with Amber text\" /&gt; Button Style TypesThere are also the outline, push, round, flat, rounded and glossy props for you to use to control some design aspects of the button. &lt;!-- an outlined button --&gt;&lt;q-btn outline color=\"teal\" label=\"Outlined Button\" /&gt;&lt;!-- a rounded push button --&gt;&lt;q-btn rounded push color=\"secondary\" label=\"Rounded Push Button\"/&gt;&lt;!-- a glossy button --&gt;&lt;q-btn glossy color=\"primary\" label=\"Glossy\" /&gt;&lt;!-- a flat dense round button --&gt;&lt;q-btn flat dense round icon=\"menu\" color=\"primary\" /&gt; Button with ProgressSome button actions involve contacting a server, so an asynchronous response. It’s best that you inform the user about a background process taking place until the asynchronous response is ready. QBtn offers this possibility through the loading prop. This property will display a QSpinner (by default) instead of the icon and/or label of the button. Custom loading content can also be used. Here is a full example highlighting what you can do with the loading property.&lt;template&gt; &lt;!-- Notice `loading` prop --&gt; &lt;q-btn :loading=\"loading\" @click=\"simulateProgress\"&gt; Button Label &lt;!-- Notice slot=\"loading\". This is optional. If missing, the default theme spinner will be used. --&gt; &lt;span slot=\"loading\"&gt;Loading...&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/q-btn&gt;&lt;/template&gt;&lt;script&gt;export default &#123; data () &#123; return &#123; loading: false &#125; &#125;, methods: &#123; simulateProgress () &#123; // we set loading state this.loading = true // simulate a delay, like in // waiting for an Ajax call setTimeout(() =&gt; &#123; // delay is over, now we reset loading state this.loading = false // DON't forget to reset loading state // otherwise the button will keep on // being in \"loading\" state &#125;, 3000) &#125; &#125;&#125;&lt;/script&gt; If you’d like to add a different spinner than the default one of the theme you are building your website/app with, you can do so by slotting in the Spinner component that you’d like. &lt;q-btn icon=\"mail\" label=\"Get Mail\" color=\"orange\" @click=\"simulateProgress\"&gt; &lt;q-spinner-facebook slot=\"loading\" size=\"20px\" /&gt;&lt;/q-btn&gt; The “loading” slot can contain anything. It’s not limited to text or spinners only. You can use whatever DOM elements or components you want. The end result is that while in “loading” state, the Button content will be replaced by whatever the “loading” slot contains. Also, while in this state, the button gets disabled so no further click events are unnecessarily triggered. Handling Deterministic ProgressShould you wish, you can also display a deterministic progress within the button by using the additional “percentage” property along with what you’ve already learned about buttons with progress:&lt;template&gt; &lt;q-btn :percentage=\"percentage\" :loading=\"loading\" label=\"Compute PI\" color=\"primary\" @click=\"startComputing\" &gt; &lt;span slot=\"loading\"&gt; &lt;q-spinner-gears class=\"on-left\" /&gt; Computing... &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/q-btn&gt;&lt;/template&gt;&lt;script&gt;// remember to also register necessary components in quasar.conf.jsexport default &#123; data () &#123; return &#123; loading: false percentage: 0 &#125; &#125;, methods: &#123; startComputing () &#123; this.loading = true this.percentage = 0 // we simulate progress here this.interval = setInterval(() =&gt; &#123; // adding a random amount of percentage this.percentage += Math.floor(Math.random() * 8 + 10) // and when we are done... if (this.percentage &gt;= 100) &#123; clearInterval(this.interval) // DON'T forget to reset loading state: this.loading = false &#125; &#125;, 700) &#125; &#125;, beforeDestroy () &#123; // we also take care of clearing interval // should the user navigate away before the progress has ended clearInterval(this.interval) &#125;&#125;&lt;/script&gt; You can also use the dark-percentage prop if your button has a light color. Controlling the Button for Form SubmissionWhen you have a button to submit a form’s input to the server, like a “Save” button, more often than not you will also want to give the user the ability to submit the form with a press of the enter key. If you would also like to give the user feedback of the saving process being in progress, and to prevent the user repeatedly pressing the button, you would need the button to show a loading spinner and be disabled from click events. QBtn allows this behavior if configured so. To control this loading feature, all you need is logic in your form which sets the v-model of the button to true. Once it is set to true, the button displays the spinner. To stop the process, set the v-model value back to false. The example below demonstrates this button control with the Enter key. &lt;template&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;!-- a simple text field watching for the enter key release --&gt; &lt;q-input v-model=\"test\" @keyup.enter=\"simulateSubmit\" /&gt; &lt;!-- A button with v-model set to submit. v-model scope variable must be a strict Boolean --&gt; &lt;q-btn :loading=\"submitting\" @click=\"simulateSubmit\" label=\"Save\"&gt; &lt;q-spinner-facebook slot=\"loading\" /&gt; &lt;/q-btn&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/template&gt;&lt;script&gt;export default &#123; data () &#123; return &#123; test: '', submitting: false &#125; &#125;, methods: &#123; simulateSubmit () &#123; this.submitting = true // Simulating a delay here. // When we are done, we reset \"submitting\" // Boolean to false to restore the // initial state. setTimeout(() =&gt; &#123; // delay simulated, we are done, // now restoring submit to its initial state this.submitting = false &#125;, 3000) &#125; &#125;&#125;&lt;/script&gt; Disabling a ButtonTo disable the button, use the disable prop. Along with a small fade applied to the Button, the @click event will no longer be triggered. &lt;q-btn color=\"primary\" disable label=\"Primary Button\" /&gt;&lt;q-btn color=\"amber\" :disable=\"booleanVar\" label=\"Amber Button\" /&gt; Using a Button with Vue RouterIf you want to use a button to navigate to a new page you don’t need to use a wrapping &lt;router-link&gt; tag. Instead, you can use the @click event to handle the route change. &lt;q-btn @click=\"$router.push('/path/to/new/page')\" color=\"primary\" label=\"navigate\"/&gt; Delaying button click eventOn Material theme you can delay a button’s @click until the material ripple has reached the edge of the button using the wait-for-ripple prop. Useful from a UI perspective as an example when you want a button to dismiss a Modal. &lt;q-btn wait-for-ripple @click=\"clickHandler\" label=\"Click Me\"/&gt; Using a click and hold buttonIf you want to trigger a button’s @click event multiple times on click and hold use the repeat-timeout prop. Accepts either a Number or a Function (returning a Number). The Number represents the time amount to wait until triggering @click event again. &lt;template&gt; &lt;!-- Click and hold to trigger every second --&gt; &lt;q-btn @click=\"clickHandler\" :repeat-timeout=\"1000\" label=\"Click Me\" /&gt; &lt;!-- Click and hold to trigger faster over time --&gt; &lt;q-btn @click=\"clickHandler\" :repeat-timeout=\"repeatFunction\" label=\"Click Me\" /&gt;&lt;/template&gt;&lt;script&gt; export default &#123; methods: &#123; clickHandler () &#123; console.log('Handler Triggered') &#125;, repeatFunction (timesTriggered) &#123; // first time timesTriggered is 0, so we add 1 // to be sure we don't divide by 0 return 1000 / (timesTriggered + 1) &#125; &#125; &#125;&lt;/script&gt;"},{"title":"Cards","updated":"2018-02-21T21:16:36.622Z","permalink":"http://quasar-framework.org/components/card.html","text":"Quasar Cards are a great way to display important pieces of content, and are quickly emerging as a core design pattern for Apps. They’re a great way to contain and organize information, while also setting up predictable expectations for the user. With so much content to display at once, and often so little screen real-estate, Cards have fast become the design pattern of choice for many companies, including the likes of Google and Twitter. Quasar Cards are a collection of components that you can use, based on the needs. It’s all about being creative. Experiment with different Web Components by embedding them in Card components to create awesome results. InstallationEdit /quasar.conf.js:framework: &#123; components: [ 'QCard', 'QCardTitle', 'QCardMain', 'QCardMedia', 'QCardSeparator', 'QCardActions' ]&#125; Basic UsageFamiliarize yourself with Card components with the examples below. The only requirement is that QCard needs to wrap all the other ones. Everything else is optional and can be inserted into your template anywhere as long as they are direct children of QCard. Following are Vue properties of QCard component: Vue Property Type Description square Boolean Squared borders instead of round ones. flat Boolean Remove shadow. inline Boolean Make it inline. Also set a CSS width to work. Take a look at Grid example on the “More Examples” section. color String One color from Quasar Color Palette. text-color String Override color of text, one from Quasar Color Palette. &lt;!-- An basic example --&gt;&lt;q-card&gt; &lt;q-card-title&gt; Card Title &lt;/q-card-title&gt; &lt;q-card-separator /&gt; &lt;q-card-main&gt; Card Content &lt;/q-card-main&gt;&lt;/q-card&gt; A more complex example:&lt;q-card inline style=\"width: 500px\"&gt; &lt;q-card-media&gt; &lt;img src=\"~assets/donuts.png\"&gt; &lt;/q-card-media&gt; &lt;q-card-title&gt; Cafe Basilico &lt;q-rating slot=\"subtitle\" v-model=\"stars\" :max=\"5\" /&gt; &lt;div slot=\"right\" class=\"row items-center\"&gt; &lt;q-icon name=\"place\" /&gt; 250 ft &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/q-card-title&gt; &lt;q-card-main&gt; &lt;p&gt;$・Italian, Cafe&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=\"text-faded\"&gt;Small plates, salads &amp; sandwiches in an intimate setting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/q-card-main&gt; &lt;q-card-separator /&gt; &lt;q-card-actions&gt; &lt;q-btn flat round dense icon=\"event\" /&gt; &lt;q-btn flat label=\"5:30PM\" /&gt; &lt;q-btn flat label=\"7:30PM\" /&gt; &lt;q-btn flat label=\"9:00PM\" /&gt; &lt;q-btn flat color=\"primary\" label=\"Reserve\" /&gt; &lt;/q-card-actions&gt;&lt;/q-card&gt; Card Title (QCardTitle)QCardTitle has three main areas (all are optional): title, subtitle (“subtitle” slot) and right side (“right” slot). Note that you can set title and subtitle as overlay on an image or video through a QCardMedia component too (see QCardMedia section). &lt;q-card-title&gt; &lt;!-- Optional. Anything that goes here without specifying \"slot\" is considered the main title --&gt; Title &lt;!-- Optional. Adding the subtitle. Notice slot=\"subtitle\" --&gt; &lt;span slot=\"subtitle\"&gt;Subtitle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;!-- Optional. Adding something on the right side, like an icon triggering a Popover with a menu.

This can be done through QCardMedia component, which supports an optional overlay too (for things like title and/or subtitle). Vue Property Type Description overlay-position String One of ‘top’, ‘bottom’ or ‘full’ which sets the position of overlay on top of media element. &lt;!-- Displaying an image --&gt;&lt;q-card-media&gt; &lt;img src=\"~assets/some-image.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/q-card-media&gt;&lt;!-- Display a video (with help of QVideo component) --&gt;&lt;q-card-media&gt; &lt;q-video src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/k3_tw44QsZQ?rel=0\" /&gt;&lt;/q-card-media&gt;&lt;!-- Displaying a Parallax (with help of QParallax) --&gt;&lt;q-card-media&gt; &lt;q-parallax :src=\"'statics/parallax1.jpg'\" :height=\"150\"&gt; &lt;div slot=\"loading\"&gt;Loading...&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/q-parallax&gt;&lt;/q-card-media&gt; Now let’s see how we can add overlays too (through “overlay” slot):&lt;q-card-media&gt; &lt;img src=\"~assets/mountains.jpg\"&gt; &lt;!-- Notice the slot=\"overlay\" --&gt; &lt;q-card-title slot=\"overlay\"&gt; Title &lt;span slot=\"subtitle\"&gt;Subtitle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/q-card-title&gt;&lt;/q-card-media&gt;&lt;!-- Overlay at top of media elements.

In this example, we skip using QCardList: &lt;q-card&gt; &lt;q-item&gt; &lt;q-item-side avatar=\"/statics/boy-avatar.png\" /&gt; &lt;q-item-main&gt; &lt;q-item-tile label&gt;Title&lt;/q-item-tile&gt; &lt;q-item-tile sublabel&gt;Subhead&lt;/q-item-tile&gt; &lt;/q-item-main&gt; &lt;/q-item&gt;&lt;/q-card&gt; Making a Grid of CardsIn order to make a grid of Cards you need to use the inline property of QCard component and set a width for your Cards. &lt;div&gt; &lt;!-- In this example every card has a \"style\" tag with a width. Consider defining a CSS class instead to ease the template syntax. --&gt; &lt;q-card inline style=\"width: 300px\"&gt;...&lt;/q-card&gt; &lt;q-card inline style=\"width: 300px\"&gt;...&lt;/q-card&gt; &lt;q-card inline style=\"width: 300px\"&gt;...&lt;/q-card&gt; ... &lt;q-card inline style=\"width: 300px\"&gt;...&lt;/q-card&gt;&lt;/div&gt; Card with CollapsiblesSince Collapsibles are List items too, it makes sense to use a QList component to encapsulate them. Also, imagine a Card with Collapsibles containing Cards. Inception :) &lt;q-card&gt; &lt;q-card-title&gt; Card with Collapsible List &lt;/q-card-title&gt; &lt;q-card-separator /&gt; &lt;q-list&gt; &lt;q-collapsible icon=\"explore\" label=\"First\"&gt; &lt;div&gt; Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet... &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/q-collapsible&gt; &lt;q-collapsible icon=\"perm_identity\" label=\"Second\"&gt; &lt;div&gt; Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet... &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/q-collapsible&gt; &lt;q-collapsible icon=\"shopping_cart\" label=\"Third\"&gt; &lt;div&gt; Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet... &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/q-collapsible&gt; &lt;/q-list&gt;&lt;/q-card&gt;"},{"title":"Carousel","updated":"2018-03-03T16:04:29.477Z","permalink":"http://quasar-framework.org/components/carousel.html","text":"Quasar Carousel is a Vue Component which you can use to display more information with less real estate, using slides.

You can use them both as Stylus variables in your CSS code or directly as CSS classes in your HTML templates. This page comes really handy after reading Quasar Theming. You might also want to check Color Utils. Brand ColorsThere can be three main colors used throughout your App, called primary, secondary and tertiary. Most of the colors that Quasar Components use are strongly linked with these three colors that you can change. Choosing these colors is the first step one should take when differentiating the design of its own App. You’ll notice immediately on changing their default values that Quasar Components follow these colors as a guideline. Color ListHere’s the list of colors provided out of the box. Use them as CSS classes (in HTML templates) or as Stylus variables (in &lt;style lang=&quot;stylus&quot;&gt; tags) within your app’s *.vue files. primary, secondary, tertiarypositive, negative, info, warning, white, light, dark, faded On the following colors there are variations available:red, pink, purple, deep-purple, indigo, blue, light-blue, cyan, teal, green, light-green, lime, yellow, amber, orange, deep-orange, brown, grey, blue-grey Example of color variation: red, red-1, red-2, …, red-14. See the demo to make a good picture of what variations are. Variation 11 to 14 are color accents. Using as CSS ClassesUse text- or bg- prefixes as class names to change the color of text or the color of the background. &lt;!-- changing text color --&gt;&lt;p class=\"text-primary\"&gt;....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- changing background color --&gt;&lt;p class=\"bg-positive\"&gt;...&lt;/p&gt; Using Stylus VariablesIn your app’s *.vue files you can use the colors as $primary, $red-1, and so on. &lt;!-- Notice lang=\"stylus\" --&gt;&lt;style lang=\"stylus\"&gt;// \"variables\" is a Webpack alias injected by Quasar CLI@import '~variables'div color $red-1 background-color $grey-5&lt;/style&gt; Adding Your Own ColorsIf you want to use colors of your own for components, let’s say we are adding a color named “brand”, all you need to do is add the following CSS into your app: .text-brand &#123; color: #a2aa33;&#125;.bg-brand &#123; background: #a2aa33;&#125; Now we can use this color for Quasar components:&lt;q-input color=\"brand\" ... /&gt; Dynamic Change of Brand Colors (Dynamic Theme Colors) WARNINGThis is only supported on browsers that support CSS Variables (Custom Properties).It is not going to work on IE11, but it will fall back to the brand colors from the CSS theme. This feature requires Quasar v0.15.7+ You can dynamically customize the brand colors during run-time: primary, secondary, tertiary, positive, negative, info, warning, light, dark, faded. That means you can have one build of your application with a default color theme but show it with a runtime selected one. The main color configuration is done using CSS custom properties, stored on the root element (:root). Each property has a name of --q-color-${name} (example: --q-color-primary, --q-color-secondary) and should have a valid CSS color as value. The CSS Custom properties use the same inheritance rules as normal CSS, so you can only redefine your desired colors and the rest will be inherited from the parent elements. The recommended workflow is to set your customized color properties on the html (document.documentElement) or body (document.body) elements. This will allow you to revert to the default color by just deleting your custom one.

If your desired language pack is missing, please provide a PR for it. QTable Vue Properties Vue Property Type Description data Array of Objects Data containing Array of rows to display. columns Array of Objects (Required) Defining each column’s properties. row-key String (Required) Property name of each row defining a unique key for the respective rows. pagination Object Use with .sync. Control of the pagination and sorting. Can enable Table “server-mode” by containing rowsNumber property. See next sections for details. rows-per-page-options Array Array of Numbers representing options for user to select how many rows per page should be shown. Example: ‘[3, 5, 7, 0]’. Notice value 0 means “All”. selection String Set selection mode. One of ‘single’, ‘multiple’ or (default) ‘none’. selected Array Use with .sync. Array of unique keys for selected row(s). visible-columns Array Array of Strings containing the ‘name’ column property value of the visible columns. loading Boolean Show a background process is in progress (like fetching data and so on). color String Color of the default Table controls (pagination, checkboxes, …). dark Boolean When using Table on a dark background. dense Boolean Dense Table, when you want to display more data using the same real estate on window. Gets activated by default on narrow windows. title String Title of Table. hide-header Boolean Hide Table header. hide-bottom Boolean Hide Table bottom (usually containing pagination controls). separator String Sets separator for rows/columns/cell. One of ‘horizontal’, ‘vertical’, ‘cell’, ‘none’. table-style String/Array/Object Style for the &lt;table&gt; tag itself. table-class String/Array/Object Classes for the &lt;table&gt; tag itself. filter String Filter String for Table used by filter-method(). filter-method Function When you want a custom filtering method. See next sections for details. Label properties are by default defined in Quasar’s i18n, but you can override them: Vue Property Type Description no-data-label String Message to display when no rows are available. no-results-label String Message to display when no rows match the filter. loading-label String Message to display when Table currently has no rows but is in the process of fetching them. selected-rows-label(rowsNumber) Function Function that returns a message (String) to display how many rows are selected. Takes a Number parameter which is the actual rows number that are selected. rows-per-page-label String Override ‘Rows per page:’ message. pagination-label(start,end,total) Function Override default ‘x-y of z’ pagination label. IMPORTANTInitial sorted column, sorting direction &amp; page is configured through the pagination prop. Check the Pagination section below. Columns DefinitionLet’s take an example of configuring columns property. Let’s assume we are telling QTable that row-key is ‘name’.columns: /* array of Objects */ [ // column Object definition &#123; // unique id (used by row-key, pagination.sortBy, ...) name: 'desc', // label for header label: 'Dessert (100g serving)', // row Object property to determine value for this column field: 'name', // OR field: row =&gt; row.some.nested.prop // (optional) if we use visible-columns, this col will always be visible required: true, // (optional) alignment align: 'left', // (optional) tell QTable you want this column sortable sortable: true // (optional) compare function if you have // some custom data or want a specific way to compare two rows sort: (a, b) =&gt; parseInt(a, 10) - parseInt(b, 10) // function return value: // * is less than 0 then sort a to an index lower than b, i.e. a comes first // * is 0 then leave a and b unchanged with respect to each other, but sorted with respect to all different elements // * is greater than 0 then sort b to an index lower than a, i.e. b comes first &#125;, &#123; name: 'calories', label: 'Calories', field: 'calories', sortable: true &#125;, &#123; name: 'fat', label: 'Fat (g)', field: 'fat', sortable: true &#125;, &#123; name: 'carbs', label: 'Carbs (g)', field: 'carbs' &#125;, &#123; name: 'protein', label: 'Protein (g)', field: 'protein' &#125;, &#123; name: 'sodium', label: 'Sodium (mg)', field: 'sodium' &#125;, &#123; name: 'calcium', label: 'Calcium (%)', field: 'calcium', sortable: true, sort: (a, b) =&gt; parseInt(a, 10) - parseInt(b, 10) &#125;, &#123; name: 'iron', label: 'Iron (%)', field: 'iron', sortable: true, sort: (a, b) =&gt; parseInt(a, 10) - parseInt(b, 10) &#125;] PaginationWhen you want to control Table’s pagination, use pagination prop, but don’t forget to add the .sync modifier: &lt;template&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;q-table :pagination.sync=\"pagination\" ... /&gt; &lt;q-btn @click=\"pagination.page++\" label=\"Next page\" ... /&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/template&gt;&lt;script&gt;export default &#123; data: () =&gt; (&#123; pagination: &#123; sortBy: null, // String, column \"name\" property value descending: false, page: 1, rowsPerPage: 5 // current rows per page being displayed &#125; &#125;)&#125; When pagination has a property named rowsNumber, then this means that you’ll be configuring Table for server-side pagination (&amp; sorting &amp; filtering). Custom Filter Method&lt;template&gt; &lt;q-table :filter=\"terms\" :filter-method=\"myFiler\" ...&lt;/template&gt;&lt;script&gt;export default &#123; data: () =&gt; (&#123; filter: '' &#125;), methods: &#123; // this is actually the default filtering method: myFilter (rows, terms, cols, cellValue) &#123; const lowerTerms = terms ? terms.toLowerCase() : '' return rows.filter( row =&gt; cols.some(col =&gt; (cellValue(col, row) + '').toLowerCase().indexOf(lowerTerms) !== -1) ) &#125; &#125;&#125;&lt;/script&gt; QTable Vue Events Vue Event Parameters Description @request Object { pagination, filter, getCellValue } Gets triggered when using server-side pagination (pagination property Object contains rowsNumber) Server-side Pagination, Filtering, SortingWhen your database contains a big number of rows for a Table, obviously it’s not feasible to load them all for multiple reasons (memory, UI rendering performance, …). Instead, you can load only a Table page. Whenever the user wants to navigate to another Table page, or wants to sort by a column or wants to filter the Table, a request is sent to the server to fetch the partial data. First step to enable this behavior is to specify pagination prop, which MUST contain rowsNumber. QTable needs to know the total number of rows available in order to correctly render the pagination links. Second step is to listen for @request event on QTable. This event is triggered when data needs to be fetched from the server because either page number or sorting or filtering changed. It’s best that you also specify the loading prop in order to notify the user that a background process is in progress. &lt;template&gt; &lt;q-table ref=\"table\" :data=\"serverData\" :columns=\"columns\" :filter=\"filter\" row-key=\"name\" :pagination.sync=\"serverPagination\" :loading=\"loading\" @request=\"request\" &gt; &lt;template slot=\"top-right\" slot-scope=\"props\"&gt; &lt;q-search hide-underline v-model=\"filter\" /&gt; &lt;/template&gt; &lt;/q-table&gt;&lt;/template&gt;&lt;script&gt;import tableData from 'assets/table-data'export default &#123; data () &#123; return &#123; filter: '', loading: false, serverPagination: &#123; page: 1, rowsNumber: 10 // specifying this determines pagination is server-side &#125;, serverData: [], columns: [ &#123; name: 'desc', required: true, label: 'Dessert (100g serving)', align: 'left', field: 'name', sortable: true &#125;, &#123; name: 'calories', label: 'Calories', field: 'calories', sortable: true &#125;, &#123; name: 'fat', label: 'Fat (g)', field: 'fat', sortable: true &#125;, &#123; name: 'carbs', label: 'Carbs (g)', field: 'carbs' &#125;, &#123; name: 'protein', label: 'Protein (g)', field: 'protein' &#125;, &#123; name: 'sodium', label: 'Sodium (mg)', field: 'sodium' &#125;, &#123; name: 'calcium', label: 'Calcium (%)', field: 'calcium', sortable: true, sort: (a, b) =&gt; parseInt(a, 10) - parseInt(b, 10) &#125;, &#123; name: 'iron', label: 'Iron (%)', field: 'iron', sortable: true, sort: (a, b) =&gt; parseInt(a, 10) - parseInt(b, 10) &#125; ] &#125; &#125;, methods: &#123; request (&#123; pagination, filter &#125;) &#123; // we set QTable to \"loading\" state this.loading = true // we do the server data fetch, based on pagination and filter received // (using Axios here, but can be anything; parameters vary based on backend implementation) axios .get(`/data/$&#123;pagination.page&#125;?sortBy=$&#123;pagination.sortBy&#125;&amp;descending=$&#123;pagination.descending&#125;&amp;filter=$&#123;filter&#125;`) .then((&#123; data &#125;) =&gt; &#123; // updating pagination to reflect in the UI this.serverPagination = pagination // we also set (or update) rowsNumber this.serverPagination.rowsNumber = data.rowsNumber // then we update the rows with the fetched ones this.serverData = data.rows // finally we tell QTable to exit the \"loading\" state this.loading = false &#125;) .catch(error =&gt; &#123; // there's an error... do SOMETHING // we tell QTable to exit the \"loading\" state this.loading = false &#125;) &#125; &#125;, mounted () &#123; // once mounted, we need to trigger the initial server data fetch this.request(&#123; pagination: this.serverPagination, filter: this.filter &#125;) &#125;&#125;&lt;/script&gt; Examples - FeaturesFilter, Column selection, Separators, Toggle Fullscreen&lt;template&gt; &lt;q-table :data=\"tableData\" :columns=\"columns\" :filter=\"filter\" :visible-columns=\"visibleColumns\" :separator=\"separator\" row-key=\"name\" color=\"secondary\" &gt; &lt;template slot=\"top-left\" slot-scope=\"props\"&gt; &lt;q-search hide-underline color=\"secondary\" v-model=\"filter\" class=\"col-6\" /&gt; &lt;/template&gt; &lt;template slot=\"top-right\" slot-scope=\"props\"&gt; &lt;q-table-columns color=\"secondary\" class=\"q-mr-sm\" v-model=\"visibleColumns\" :columns=\"columns\" /&gt; &lt;q-select color=\"secondary\" v-model=\"separator\" :options=\"[ &#123; label: 'Horizontal', value: 'horizontal' &#125;, &#123; label: 'Vertical', value: 'vertical' &#125;, &#123; label: 'Cell', value: 'cell' &#125;, &#123; label: 'None', value: 'none' &#125; ]\" hide-underline /&gt; &lt;q-btn flat round dense :icon=\"props.inFullscreen ?

For example:columns: [ &#123; name: 'author', label: 'Author', field: row =&gt; row.author.name &#125;] Then you can go even further and format the value for a specific column in your column definition. Example:columns: [ &#123; name: 'author', label: 'Author', field: row =&gt; row.author.name, format: val =&gt; `$&#123;val&#125;%` &#125;] The value returned by field is used for sorting rows, while the format value is specifically meant for displaying a value to the user. This is very useful for cases where you need to sort by the initial value of your data. You can (if you want to), however, avoid the format and use custom scoped slots (row, column cell) for defining how Quasar should format the cell(s).

Most Quasar date functions take as parameter either a Unix timestamp or a String representing a date which needs to be parsable by the native JS Date constructor. Some examples: 1497159857411, Sun Jun 11 2017 08:44:42 GMT+0300, 2017-06-16. Returned values are all JS Dates. Get familiar with JS native Date class, which is very powerful, and remember that you don’t need solutions like Momentjs which add hundreds of minified KB to your bundle. Helping Tree-ShakeYou will notice all examples import date Object from Quasar. However, if you need only one method from it, then you can use ES6 destructuring to help Tree Shaking embed only that method and not all of date. Example with addToDate():// we import all of `date`import &#123; date &#125; from 'quasar'// destructuring to keep only what is neededconst &#123; addToDate &#125; = datelet newDate = addToDate(new Date(), &#123; days: 7, months: 1 &#125;) Format for displayIt takes a string of tokens and replaces them with their corresponding date values:import &#123; date &#125; from 'quasar'let timeStamp = Date.now()let formattedString = date.formatDate(timeStamp, 'YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.SSSZ') For i18n, you can use a third parameter:let formattedString = date.formatDate(timesStamp, 'MMMM - dddd', &#123; dayNames: ['Duminica', 'Luni', /* and all the rest of days - remember starting with Sunday */], monthNames: ['Ianuarie', 'Februarie', /* and all the rest of months */]&#125;) Available format tokens: Unit Formats available Year YY: 70 71 … 29 30YYYY: 1970 1971 … 2029 2030 Month M: 1 2 … 11 12MM: 01 02 … 11 12MMM: Jan Feb … Nov DecMMMM: January February … November December Quarter Q: Quarter number 1 2 3 4Qo: Quarter number 1st 2nd 3rd 4th Day of Month D: 1 2 … 30 31Do: 1st 2nd … 30th 31stDD: 01 02 … 30 31 Day of Year DDD: 1 2 … 364 365DDDD: 001 002 … 364 365 Day of Week d: 0 1 … 5 6dd: Su Mo … Fr Saddd: Sun Mon … Fri Satdddd: Sunday Monday … Friday Saturday Day of Week (ISO) E: 1 2 … 6 7 Week of Year w: 1 2 … 52 53ww: 01 02 … 52 53 Hour H: 0 1 … 22 23HH: 00 01 … 22 23h: 0 … 11 12hh: 01 02 … 11 12 Minute m: 0 1 … 58 59mm: 00 01 … 58 59 Second s: 0 1 … 58 59ss: 00 01 … 58 59 Fractional Second S: 0 1 … 8 9SS: 00 01 … 98 99SSS: 000 001 … 998 999 Timezone offset Z: -07:00 -06:00 … +06:00 +07:00ZZ: -0700 -0600 … +0600 +0700 AM/PM A: AM, PMa: am, pmaa: a.m, p.m Unix Timestamp X: 1360013296x (ms): 1360013296123 Manipulate datesCreateTry to create dates with native JS Date class like so:let date = new Date(); The following method is just a wrapper to help you in cases where you just need current time but with a different year, or month, or second etc. import &#123; date &#125; from 'quasar'let newDate = date.buildDate(&#123; year:2010, date:5, hours:15, milliseconds:123&#125;) You can pass a third argument (a boolean) for setting UTC time (true) instead of local time.

They also can provide the user with important information, or require them to make a decision (or multiple decisions). From a UI perspective, you can think of Dialogs as a type of “floating” modal, which covers only a portion of the screen. This means Dialogs should only be used for quick actions, like password verification, small App notifications or quick options. More in depth user flows should be reserved for ​Modals​. Dialogs can be used either as a component in your Vue file templates (for complex use-cases, like specific form components with validation etc), or as a globally available method (for some basic use cases, equivalent to native JS alert(), prompt(), …). Basic Usage as a MethodFirst, we install it: Edit /quasar.conf.js:framework: &#123; plugins: ['Dialog']&#125; Now let’s see how we can use it:// outside of a Vue fileimport &#123; Dialog &#125; from 'quasar'(Promise) Dialog.create(configObj)// inside of a Vue file(Promise) this.$q.dialog(configObj) Basic syntax for the config object:this.$q.dialog(&#123; title: 'Warning', message: 'You are about to run out of disk space.', // optional color: 'primary', // optional; we want an \"OK\" button ok: true, // takes i18n value, or String for \"OK\" button label // optional; we want a \"Cancel\" button cancel: true, // takes i18n value, or String for \"Cancel\" button label // optional; prevent user dismissal when not clicking on a Dialog button preventClose: true, noBackdropDismiss: false, // gets set to \"true\" automatically if preventClose is \"true\" noEscDismiss: false, // gets set to \"true\" automatically if preventClose is \"true\" // optional; stacks button vertically instead of horizontally (default) // optional; a position of the Dialog (top, bottom, left, right) position: 'top', // optional; show an input box (make Dialog similar to a JS prompt) prompt: &#123; model: '', type: 'text' // optional &#125;, // optional; show a radio, checkbox or toggle options: &#123; type: 'radio', // or 'checkbox' / 'toggle' model: 'opt2', // Array when checkbox/toggle! (like '[]') items: [ &#123;label: 'Option 1', value: 'opt1', color: 'secondary'&#125;, &#123;label: 'Option 2', value: 'opt2'&#125;, &#123;label: 'Option 3', value: 'opt3'&#125; ] &#125;&#125;) IMPORTANTWhen user hits the phone/tablet back button (only for Cordova apps), the Action Sheet will get closed automatically.Also, when on a desktop browser, hitting the &lt;ESCAPE&gt; key also closes the Action Sheet.

Doesn’t depend on field helper existance. count Number/Boolean Add a counter of characters or items (like Chips) in your wrapped form component. If Boolean, it just counts them. If Number, it also adds a maximum number to it, but doesn’t acts as a restraint. inset String Inset you field to align with other fields when current one is missing an icon and/or label. One of ‘icon’, ‘label’ or ‘full’ (inset for both icon and label). orientation String Overrides the responsive orientation. One of ‘vertical’ or ‘horizontal’. label-width Number Out of 12 grid points, how much should the label take? Default is 5.

It’s simple, lightweight and model-based. You need to have Vuelidate added to your project first. See here. &lt;template&gt; &lt;q-field icon=\"mail\" label=\"Email\" helper=\"Type the email we can use to contact you\" :error=\"$v.email.$error\" error-label=\"Please type a valid email\" count &gt; &lt;q-input type=\"email\" v-model=\"email\" @blur=\"$v.email.$touch\" /&gt; &lt;/q-field&gt;&lt;/template&gt;&lt;script&gt;import &#123; required, email &#125; from 'vuelidate/lib/validators'export default &#123; data () &#123; return &#123; email: '' &#125; &#125;, validations: &#123; email: &#123; required, email &#125; &#125;&#125;&lt;/script&gt; Float Label QInput&lt;q-field icon=\"cloud\" helper=\"Helper\"&gt; &lt;q-input v-model=\"model\" float-label=\"Float Label\" /&gt;&lt;/q-field&gt; Custom Label WidthIf you customize label width for one QField then it’s best to apply it to all its sibling QFields for UI consistency.Since Quasar is using a 12 point grid system, assign a number &gt;= 1 and &lt; 12 for the label width. Default is 5. &lt;q-field helper=\"Helper\" :label-width=\"3\" label=\"Label\"&gt; &lt;q-input v-model=\"model\" /&gt;&lt;/q-field&gt; Using InsetInset is useful to perfectly align all QFields when some have icons and labels and some are missing either or both of them. If, for example, no QField uses icon, then it makes sense to not add inset for any of the QFields. Same goes for label. &lt;!-- This example has icon and label. Since having both of them, it gets set as reference for the other QFields when adding inset to them.--&gt;&lt;q-field icon=\"cloud\" helper=\"Helper\" label=\"Horizontal\"&gt; &lt;q-input v-model=\"model\" /&gt;&lt;/q-field&gt;&lt;!-- This example has only label, so we inset for the icon (because there is at least one QField having icon too)--&gt;&lt;q-field helper=\"Helper\" label=\"Label\" inset=\"icon\"&gt; &lt;q-input v-model=\"model\" /&gt;&lt;/q-field&gt;&lt;!-- This example has no icon or label, so we inset for them both (as there is a sibling QField with both icon and label).--&gt;&lt;q-field helper=\"Helper\" inset=\"full\"&gt; &lt;q-input v-model=\"model\" /&gt;&lt;/q-field&gt; Wrapping Side by Side QInputsWe use Quasar CSS Flex to create a non wrappable row where we place two QInputs. When more than one Form component is wrapped by QField, avoid adding a counter to QField because only one will end up synching its length to it. Each Form component has its own length and there’s only one placeholder for the counter, so in the end you will only confuse the user. &lt;!-- Example featuring stacked labels --&gt;&lt;q-field icon=\"security\" helper=\"Helper\" label=\"Label\"&gt; &lt;!-- We create a row --&gt; &lt;div class=\"row no-wrap\"&gt; &lt;q-input class=\"col\" v-model=\"model\" stack-label=\"Input 1\" /&gt; &lt;q-input class=\"col\" v-model=\"model\" stack-label=\"Input 2\" /&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/q-field&gt; Dark BackgroundWhen placing a QField on a dark background, use dark property to inform QField it needs to adjust colors. &lt;!-- This example has a wrapping &lt;div&gt; with a dark background associated with it.--&gt;&lt;div class=\"bg-grey-9\" style=\"padding: 10px\"&gt; &lt;!-- Notice \"dark\" property --&gt; &lt;q-field dark label=\"Knob\" helper=\"Touch to change\" icon=\"cake\" :error=\"error\" &gt; &lt;q-knob v-model=\"knob\" :min=\"knobMin\" :max=\"knobMax\" &gt; &lt;q-icon class=\"on-left\" name=\"volume_up\" /&gt; &#123;&#123;knob&#125;&#125; &lt;/q-knob&gt; &lt;/q-field&gt;&lt;/div&gt; Option GroupHere’s an example with an Option Group component. &lt;q-field icon=\"flight_takeoff\" label=\"Flight\" helper=\"Pick the day when you want to go\"&gt; &lt;q-option-group type=\"radio\" v-model=\"option\" :options=\"[ &#123; label: 'Monday', value: 'monday' &#125;, &#123; label: 'Tuesday', value: 'tuesday' &#125;, &#123; label: 'Friday', value: 'friday' &#125; ]\" /&gt;&lt;/q-field&gt;"},{"title":"Flex CSS","updated":"2018-03-18T17:13:37.602Z","permalink":"http://quasar-framework.org/components/flex-css.html","text":"Quasar provides lots of CSS classes to help you build your UI easily with the help of Flexbox. Think of it like operating with rows and columns with many options at hand. The final section of this page will show you how to create responsive UIs. Also take a look at the demo (best viewed by clicking “Desktop View” when on a desktop, because that’s where you can resize the window width to see helper classes in action). Click on “View Source” too to see the demo’s source code. Background on FlexboxThe Flexbox Layout (Flexible Box) module (currently a W3C Last Call Working Draft) aims at providing a more efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown and/or dynamic (thus the word “flex”). The main idea behind the flex layout is to give the container the ability to alter its items’ width/height (and order) to best fill the available space (mostly to accommodate to all kind of display devices and screen sizes). A flex container expands items to fill available free space, or shrinks them to prevent overflow. Most importantly, the flexbox layout is direction-agnostic as opposed to the regular layouts (block which is vertically-based and inline which is horizontally-based). While those work well for pages, they lack flexibility (no pun intended) to support large or complex applications (especially when it comes to orientation changing, resizing, stretching, shrinking, etc.). Getting StartedQuasar Flex CSS classes apply to either the Container (Parent) or the Container’s items (Children). Parent ClassesSetting DirectionOne of the following CSS classes is mandatory for the parent in order for the children ones (described in next sections) to have any effect. Class Name Description row Flex row row inline Inline Flex row column Flex column column inline Inline Flex column row reverse Flex row with flex-direction set to row-reverse column reverse Flex column with flex-direction set to column-reverse Example:&lt;div class=\"row\"&gt; &lt;div&gt;First column&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;Second column&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;Third column&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; Wrapping by defaultBy default, all rows and columns are wrapping content. However if you explicitly do not want to wrap and by so doing you want to fit all content into one line, then add no-wrap CSS helper class. Also, if you want to wrap in reverse order, then reverse-wrap is available. Class Name Description wrap Wrap if necessary (“on” by default, no need to specify it) no-wrap Do NOT wrap even if necessary reverse-wrap Wrap backwards if necessary AlignmentFor alignment along the main axis, use classes below. It helps distribute extra free space left over when either all the flex items on a line are inflexible, or are flexible but have reached their maximum size. It also exerts some control over the alignment of items when they overflow the line. For alignment perpendicular to the main axis, use classes below. This defines the default behavior for how flex items are laid out along the cross axis on the current line. Think of it as the horizontal-* version for the cross-axis (perpendicular to the main-axis). The next classes align a flex container’s lines within when there is extra space in the cross-axis, similar to how horizontal-* aligns individual items within the main-axis. Children ClassesDistribution of SizeQuasar uses a 12 point column system for distributing size of row children. Here are some examples of the CSS helper classes available: &lt;div class=\"row\"&gt; &lt;div class=\"col-8\"&gt;two thirds&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=\"col-2\"&gt;one sixth&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=\"col-auto\"&gt;auto size based on content and available space&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=\"col\"&gt;fills remaining available space&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; In the example above, col-8 fills two thirds (2/3) of the row width, because 8/12 = 2/3 = 66%, while col-2 occupies one sixth (2/12 = 1/6 ~ 16.67%). CSS helper class col-auto makes the cell fill only the space it needs to be rendered, with the possibility to shrink when not enough space is available. col, on the other hand, tries to fill all space available while also shrinking if needed. Another example with a visual representation below it:&lt;div class=\"row\"&gt; &lt;div class=\"col\"&gt;1&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=\"col\"&gt;1&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=\"col\"&gt;1&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- we have 3 children, so equivalent to above would be to use `col-4` on each of the children --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=\"row\"&gt; &lt;div class=\"col-3\"&gt;1&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=\"col-6\"&gt;2&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=\"col-3\"&gt;1&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; There’s also the possible to offset a cell. Example: offset-4 which offsets a third of space (4/12 = 1/3 = 33%). WrappingWrapping is a key feature in understanding Flex CSS classes. You are not bound to use exactly 12 points per row. You can use less or even more. This allows you, among other things, to dynamically stack rows vertically on smaller screens while displaying them on a single line on bigger screens. Read “Responsive Design” section. &lt;div class=\"row\"&gt; &lt;div class=\"col-2\"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- 2 + 6 &lt; 12, so next element is placed on same line --&gt; &lt;div class=\"col-6\"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- 2 + 6 + 10 &gt; 12, so next element wraps to next line --&gt; &lt;div class=\"col-10\"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- 10 + 3 &gt; 12, so next element wraps to next line. Note that we take into consideration the current line only (with col-10 only, since it was wrapped to its own line). --&gt; &lt;div class=\"col-3\"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; Note that rows are wrappable by default. Should you wish to disable this, use no-wrap CSS helper class. Self AlignmentAn item can override the aligned specified on parent. This allows alignment to be overridden for individual flex items. Please see the Alignment explanation from Parent Classes to understand the available values (self-start, self-center, self-baseline, self-end, self-stretch). OrderYou can set the order of children elements by using order-first and order-last CSS helper classes. By default, flex items are laid out in the source order. However, the order property controls the order in which they appear in the flex container. If you need more granularity, use order CSS property and assign the desired value. Example:&lt;div class=\"row\"&gt; &lt;div style=\"order: 2\"&gt;Second column&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=\"order-last\"&gt;Third column&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=\"order-first\"&gt;First column&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; Here is how the CSS order property works: Responsive DesignFlex CSS Helper classes can be applied based on the width of the screen, to help you in making a responsive UI. The 12 points grid is inspired by Bootstrap’s, so there are a lot of similarities. What we’ve learned so far is that, for example, we can size the columns regardless of window width. If we are to create a response UI, we need to dynamically change the sizing while taking into account how wide the window is. First, let’s learn about some tokens that you can inject at middle of col-*, offset-* and col-auto helper classes (look at table below for tokens). Token Max window width Description / When it applies xs 576px Extra small sized window sm 768px Small sized window md 992px Medium-sized window lg 1200px Large sized window xl Infinite Extra large sized window Example: col-md-7, offset-lg-3, col-xs-auto. Before diving into examples, make sure you read and understood Children Classes &gt; Wrapping because it is key to understanding how you can build a responsive design. A full example: let’s say we have a row with three children. On extra small windows, we need to stack the children vertically, on small windows we need to display them side by side (each having equal width), and starting with medium windows we should display them all on same line: &lt;div class=\"row\"&gt; &lt;div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-4\"&gt; col &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-4\"&gt; col &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-4\"&gt; col &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; Notice in the above example that we used col-xs-12 (12/12 = 100% of row, so each child will take full width of the container making all children stack vertically, since rows are wrapping content by default), col-sm-6 (6/12 = 50% of row) and col-md-4 (4/12 = 33% of row). Like previously mentioned, rows wrap content by default, so when 12 (or more) grid points are used for a row, content is wrapped to the next line. If we have two &lt;div&gt;s and we use col-8 on both, they will also stack, since 8 + 8 = 16 and we can only display 12 points on a single line. &lt;div class=\"row\"&gt; &lt;!-- more than 12 grid points together, so second &lt;div&gt; will wrap on next line --&gt; &lt;div class=\"col-8\"&gt;col&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=\"col-8\"&gt;col&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; Also check CSS Helpers &gt; Visibility page to see thresholds on window width and these tokens (xs, sm, md, lg, xl) used on their own to hide or show DOM elements. Customize breakpointsIf you want to customize existing responsive breakpoints or add new ones, you can edit the $size Stylus variable: $sizes = &#123; xs: 0, sm: 575px md: 767px lg: 991px xl: 1199px&#125; Using GuttersThere are 5 types of gutter, depending on the amount of space that you want between your elements: Class Name Size Description gutter-xs 8px extra small gutter gutter-sm 16px small gutter gutter-md 32px medium gutter gutter-lg 48px large gutter gutter-xl 64px extra large gutter Let’s look at a basic example. Please take note of the structure. You need a wrapping &lt;div&gt; and your content must be inside the &lt;div&gt; which has col-* CSS helper classes. The gutter classes make use of negative margins, so if your flex grid content is contained within, for example, a q-collapsible with a clickable area immediately above the flex grid, you must specify class=&quot;overflow-hidden&quot; to avoid the contents overlapping the active area of the parent component. &lt;!-- Example with extra small gutter and two equal width cols --&gt;&lt;!-- wrapping &lt;div&gt; required --&gt;&lt;div class=\"overflow-hidden\"&gt; &lt;!-- the row with a type of gutter --&gt; &lt;div class=\"row gutter-xs\"&gt; &lt;div class=\"col-6\"&gt; &lt;!-- Your content here --&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=\"col-6\"&gt; &lt;!-- Your content here --&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; IMPORTANTSome components have default margins, like the form components. This will add to the gutter, which is probably not what you want. For such cases, use no-margin class on those components, like in the example below: &lt;div class=\"overflow-hidden\"&gt; &lt;div class=\"row gutter-xs\"&gt; &lt;div class=\"col-6\"&gt; &lt;q-input v-model=\"model\" class=\"no-margin\" /&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=\"col-6\"&gt; &lt;q-input v-model=\"model\" class=\"no-margin\" /&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; By default, the gutter applies both horizontally and vertically. If for example you different levels of gutter only horizontally or only vertically, use gutter-x-* and gutter-y-* CSS classes:&lt;!-- small gutter horizontally, large gutter vertically --&gt;&lt;div class=\"overflow-hidden\"&gt; &lt;div class=\"row gutter-x-sm gutter-y-lg\"&gt; &lt;div class=\"col-6\"&gt; &lt;q-input v-model=\"model\" class=\"no-margin\" /&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=\"col-6\"&gt; &lt;q-input v-model=\"model\" class=\"no-margin\" /&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; QInput ExampleLet’s say we want to build something depicted in the two picture below.… which becomes like below on xs windows: The template for this would look like below. Note we are using no-margin CSS helper class for QInputs to not add additional space to gutter.&lt;div&gt; &lt;div class=\"row gutter-sm\"&gt; &lt;div class=\"col-12\"&gt; &lt;q-input inverted v-model=\"model\" class=\"no-margin\" float-label=\"col-12\" /&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6\"&gt; &lt;q-input inverted v-model=\"model\" class=\"no-margin\" float-label=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6 TOP LEFT\" /&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6\"&gt; &lt;q-input inverted v-model=\"model\" class=\"no-margin\" float-label=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6 TOP RIGHT\" /&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6\"&gt; &lt;q-input inverted v-model=\"model\" class=\"no-margin\" float-label=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6 BOTTOM LEFT\" /&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6\"&gt; &lt;q-input inverted v-model=\"model\" class=\"no-margin\" float-label=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6 BOTTOM RIGHT\" /&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=\"col-12\"&gt; &lt;q-input inverted v-model=\"model\" class=\"no-margin\" float-label=\"col-12\" /&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"},{"title":"Floating Action Buttons","updated":"2018-03-03T16:04:29.483Z","permalink":"http://quasar-framework.org/components/floating-action-button.html","text":"A Floating Action Button (FAB) represents the primary action in an App Page.

More specifically, how to manage buttons on your layout/page that should make your App “go back” to the previous screen. If you have no knowledge of Vue Router, we highly recommend you read and understand how it works first. Navigation ScenarioConsider this situation: We have an App with two pages (so two routes): a login page (route “/“) and another page with a list of items on multiple layout tabs- Let’s call this page “List page” from now on, where each tab has a route like “/list/shoes”, “/list/hats”. The Login page redirects to List page and List page has a “Logout” button, which redirects the user to the Login page. How would you handle this situation? Normally, you’d write code like below for the Login and Logout button (we won’t go into details of handling the login information and communicating with a server as this is outside of our point here): &lt;!-- Login button --&gt;&lt;q-btn @click=\"$router.push('/list')\"&gt;Login&lt;/q-btn&gt;&lt;!-- Logout button --&gt;&lt;q-btn @click=\"$router.push('/login')\"&gt;Logout&lt;/q-btn&gt; Now you build your App and install it on a phone. You open up the App, hit login then logout, then the phone’s back button. What you most likely want is for your App to exit at this point… but it doesn’t! It goes to the “/list” route instead. It’s kind of obvious why. Web history builds up as you hit the buttons:# Start App--&gt; window.history.length is 1# Hit Login button--&gt; window.history.length is 2# Hit Logout button--&gt; window.history.length is 3! What you’d like instead, is when you hit the Logout button, the window.history.length to be 1 again. Quasar can handle this automatically for you. Read about the v-go-back Vue directive. Directive “v-go-back”Let’s rewrite the Logout button to act as we would actually want it to work, which is to make window.history.length be 1 again. First, we install the directive. Edit /quasar.conf.js:framework: &#123; directives: ['GoBack']&#125; Then we use it:&lt;!-- Logout button --&gt;&lt;q-btn v-go-back=\" '/' \" color=\"primary\" label=\"Logout\"/&gt; This directive determines if the Platform is Cordova, and if so, it performs a window.history.back() call instead of a $router.push(&#39;/&#39;). QuirksNow you may think everything will work smoothly, but you must be careful about how your app is stacking up the window history. Remember, we started out by saying that the List page has a layout with multiple tabs, each one with its own route (“/list/shoes”, “/list/hats”). If we’d use to=&quot;/list/shoes&quot; and to=&quot;/list/hats&#39;&quot; on your Tabs (read more about Tabs here), then window history will build up when switching between the tabs. This incorrect behavior for apps is due to Vue Router pushing routes to the history by default. What you’d like instead, is for your window history length to stay the same, even if routes change. Fortunately, Vue Router comes to the rescue with the replace property, which essentially replaces current route instead of pushing it as a new route. So, besides to=&quot; &#39;...route...&#39; &quot; you should add the replace attribute (becoming to=&quot; &#39;...route...&#39; &quot; replace). This will replace the current route in the window history rather than pushing it. The same applies to &lt;router-link&gt;s. Always think about how you redirect your App to a new route, depending on what you want to achieve. Think if you really want to push a new route to window history or if you want to “replace” the current route. Otherwise the phone/tablet/browser “Back” button won’t work quite as expected. Instead of finally exiting the App, it will make you go through all the routes in the reverse order they were visited. So when you hit back and go to the Login page, you’d expect another back to make the App exit, but it might make your App go to one of the List tabs, depending on the user’s navigation history."},{"title":"Icons","updated":"2018-03-18T17:13:37.603Z","permalink":"http://quasar-framework.org/components/icons.html","text":"The Quasar Icon component allows you to easily insert icons within other components or any other area of your pages, as you’d like.Quasar currently supports: Material Icons , Font Awesome, Ionicons, MDI and IcoMoon. Except for IcoMoon (which has a license), you can either choose to use only one of them or use multiple. Quasar just needs to know which icon set to use for its components. We’ll see how we can install an icon set in the following section.Please submit a request if your favorite font icon is not listed here. InstallingIf you are building a website only, then using a CDN (Content Delivery Network) approach can be an option you can follow. However, when building a mobile or Electron app, you most likely do not want to depend on an Internet connection, so it’s best that you follow the next steps. IMPORTANTDue to the license of IcoMoon and its custom build option, this icon font is not provided by out of the box. You will need to use their website to create your custom icon font files and then copy them to your app’s folder and import them in an app plugin ($ quasar new plugin icomoon). Adding an Icon SetFirst step is to make an icon set available in your website/app. For this, edit /quasar.conf.js: extras: [ 'material-icons'] Icon sets are available through quasar-extras package. You don’t need to import it in your app, just configure /quasar.conf.js as indicated. Adding more than one set (showing all options):extras: [ 'material-icons', 'mdi', 'ionicons', 'fontawesome'] Quasar Using an Icon SetUnless configured otherwise, Quasar uses Material Icons as its icon set for its components. You can however tell Quasar to use some other icon set, but be sure to include that set in your website/app (see step above: Adding an Icon Set). So let’s say we included Ionicons and we want Quasar to use it for its components. We edit /quasar.conf.js again: framework: &#123; iconSet: 'ionicons'&#125; Full ExampleHere is an example of including Ionicons &amp; Fontawesome and telling Quasar to use Fontawesome for its components. extras: [ 'ionicons', 'fontawesome'],framework: &#123; iconSet: 'fontawesome'&#125; This will enable you to use both Ionicons &amp; Fontawesome in your app, and all Quasar components will display Fontawesome icons. Including from CDNIf you want to make use of CDNs (Content Delivery Network), all you need is to include style tags in your index.template.html which point to the CDN URL. In case you follow this path, do not also add the icon sets that you want in /quasar.conf.js &gt; extras. Simply edit index.template.html as follows. The example link tag below would include Font Awesome v4.7.0 icons. Do a Google search for CDNs to make sure you include the latest version. Following are just examples. &lt;!-- in `/src/index.template.html` --&gt;&lt;head&gt; ... &lt;!-- CDN example for Material Icons --&gt; &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons\" &gt; &lt;!-- CDN example for Fontawesome --&gt; &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css\" &gt; &lt;!-- CDN example for Ioniocns --&gt; &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"http://code.ionicframework.com/ionicons/2.0.1/css/ionicons.min.css\" &gt;&lt;/head&gt; Using Fontawesome-ProIf you have a Fontawesome 5 Pro license and want to use it instead Fontawesome Free version.

Watch for CSS class clashes though. &lt;style lang=\"stylus\"&gt;.big-icon font-size: 5rem&lt;/style&gt; Adding a click event handle.

Property Type Description type String Must be one of the following: text (default), textarea, email, tel, number, password and url. This is important as it determines the keyboard type popping up on mobile devices. readonly Boolean If set to true, textfield is readonly and the user cannot change value. clearable Boolean If set to true, the component offers the user an actionable icon to remove the entered text. no-pass-toggle Boolean If type is ‘password’ and set to true, then password toggle is not shown. upper-case Boolean Transform input to upper case. When you set type to “number”, there are some additional properties that you can use: Property Type Description decimals Number Maximum number of decimals that should be displayed. numeric-keyboard-toggle Boolean Some mobile keyboards do not allow to type the dot to compose a floating number, so this property adds an icon that when clicked/tapped it toggles the keyboard to/from an alphanumeric one. Also note you can use the native DOM attributes of an input: “min”, “max”, “step”. When you set type to “textarea”, these is an additional property that you can use: Property Type Description max-height Number Number in pixels that determines the maximum height of textarea which auto-grows.

Password InputIf you use the input type password, the component will hide the characters entered by the user, but it will also offer the user a clickable icon to toggle the input, to make the input legible. &lt;q-input v-model=\"text\" type=\"password\" float-label=\"Password\" /&gt; Number InputThe below example shows a number input type.&lt;q-input v-model=\"number\" type=\"number\" float-label=\"Number\" /&gt; Prefixes and SuffixesYou can add a text before or after the field as part of an input mask, for instance, for showing Euro or US Dollar currency. &lt;!-- Notice prefix property --&gt;&lt;q-input v-model=\"number\" type=\"number\" prefix=\"$US\" stack-label=\"Number\" /&gt;&lt;!-- Notice suffix property --&gt;&lt;q-input v-model=\"number\" type=\"number\" suffix=\"€\" stack-label=\"Number\" /&gt;&lt;!-- Notice suffix property --&gt;&lt;q-input v-model=\"email\" type=\"email\" suffix=\"@gmail.com\" stack-label=\"Type Google Email\" /&gt; Error StateYou can control the color to show a mistake in user input or some other systematic error. To do this set the error prop to true. &lt;q-input :error=\"error\" v-model=\"text\" float-label=\"Colored Black\" color=\"black\" /&gt; If you’d like to show the user an explanatory text about the error condition, you can wrap the QInput in a QField component. &lt;!-- Notice error prop is now used on wrapper QField instead of on QInput now--&gt;&lt;q-field :error=\"error\" error-label=\"Oh buggers! You made a boo boo.\"&gt; &lt;q-input v-model=\"text\" float-label=\"Colored with Error\" color=\"amber\" /&gt;&lt;/q-field&gt; Please refer to the QField documentation for more info about its usage. Loading StateIf, for some reason, the input requires some longer term background action or process, you can add a spinner to indicate progress by setting the loading prop to true. &lt;q-input :loading=\"loading\" v-model=\"text\" placeholder=\"Add some text...\" /&gt; Vue Methods Vue Method Description clear() Clear the model. Sets it to empty String &#39;&#39;. togglePass() Applies to type “password” only. Toggles between showing legible password or not. focus() Focused the textfield. blur() Makes textfield lose focus. select() Selects all textfield text and focuses. Vue Events Vue Event Description @input(newVal) Triggered on immediate model value change. @change(newVal) Triggered on lazy model value change. @focus Triggered on focus. @blur Triggered a blur. @keydown Triggered by keydown event on textfield. @keyup Triggered by keyup event on textfield. @click Triggered by a native click event on textfield. FormattingIt is possible to add formatting to a QInput in two ways. One is for the basic component. The other is with the QField component. Both methods offer “inverted” coloring. Additional Vue Properties Property Type Description color String The color the QInput should have. The default is primary. inverted Boolean Set to true, to color field’s background set by the color prop. inverted-light Boolean Set to true, to color field’s background set by the color prop (when that color is light). dark Boolean Set to true, if the field is on a dark background. It will invert the text color to make it light. align Text Controls the ‘right’, ‘center’ or ‘left’ alignment of the input. The default is ‘left’. Basic Formatting ExamplesThis will color the field black. &lt;q-input v-model=\"text\" float-label=\"Colored\" color=\"black\" /&gt; This will show an inverted colored input field in amber. Here, the text is automatically inverted to a lighter color. &lt;q-input v-model=\"text\" inverted-light color=\"amber\" stack-label=\"Amber Colored Background\" /&gt; AlignmentYou can also align the input to the right, center or left. The default is left. The below example will show a field for Euro currency input. &lt;!-- Align textfield content to the right --&gt;&lt;q-input v-model=\"number\" align=\"right\" type=\"number\" suffix=\"€\" stack-label=\"Number\" /&gt; Basic Usage with QFieldIt is also possible to further enhance a QInput by wrapping it in a QField component. &lt;div class=\"bg-grey-9\" style=\"width: 500px; padding: 25px\"&gt; &lt;q-field icon=\"wifi\" label=\"Some Label\" :count=\"10\" helper=\"Some helper\" :error=\"error\" error-label=\"Some error\" &gt; &lt;q-input v-model=\"text\" dark color=\"yellow\" float-label=\"Textfield\" /&gt; &lt;/q-field&gt;&lt;/div&gt; The above usage of QField will show the input field within a dark grey background with an inverse white text. Notice the usage of the dark prop for QInput. This controls the inversion of the text color. Please refer to the QField documentation for more info about its usage. Validations with VuelidateQuasar’s recommendation for doing form components validations is Vuelidate as it fits great with the overall architecture. It’s simple, lightweight and model-based. You need to have Vuelidate added to your project first. See here. &lt;template&gt; &lt;q-input type=\"email\" :error=\"$v.email.$error\" v-model=\"email\" @blur=\"$v.email.$touch\" /&gt;&lt;/template&gt;&lt;script&gt;import &#123; required, email &#125; from 'vuelidate/lib/validators'export default &#123; data () &#123; return &#123; email: '' &#125; &#125;, validations: &#123; email: &#123; required, email &#125; &#125;&#125;&lt;/script&gt; For more options like displaying an error label, a helper or character counter, wrap QInput with a QField. Here is a more involved example. Directive Modifiers for v-modelVue comes with standard modifiers on v-model, which can be useful in conjunction with QInput. They are .lazy and .trim. .lazyVue will soon supply the .lazy modifier for v-model on components too, but until then, you can use the longer equivalent form:&lt;q-input :value=\"model\" @change=\"val =&gt; &#123; model = val &#125;\"/&gt; .trimIf you want the user’s input to be trimmed automatically, you can add the trim modifier to your v-model managed inputs: &lt;q-input v-model.trim=\"msg\" /&gt;"},{"title":"Integrating Layout with Router","updated":"2018-02-21T21:16:36.636Z","permalink":"http://quasar-framework.org/components/integrating-layout-with-router.html","text":"You can benefit from Vue Router’s capabilities while structuring your routes with a Quasar Layout. The information below is just a recommendation and not mandatory to follow. Quasar allows you full freedom. Take the lines below only as an example. Layout is the component used to encapsulate pages, so that multiple pages will share the same header, left / right side and so on. However, you can also configure per page header/footer/left or right side, but they all must be children of QLayout component. In order to understand how this works, you need a little bit of reading on Vue Router nested routes. ExampleTo make it more clear, let’s take an example. We have one layout (‘user’) and two pages (‘user-feed’ and ‘user-profile’). We want to configure the website/app routes like this: /user/feed and /user/profile. First, we create the layout and its pages:$ quasar new layout user app:new Generated layout: src/layouts/user.vue +0ms app:new Make sure to reference it in src/router/routes.js +2ms$ quasar new page user-feed user-profile app:new Generated page: src/pages/user-feed.vue +0ms app:new Make sure to reference it in src/router/routes.js +2ms app:new Generated page: src/pages/user-profile.vue +1ms app:new Make sure to reference it in src/router/routes.js +0ms The commands above create the following folder structure:src/├── layouts│ └── user.vue # our QLayout definition└── pages ├── user-feed.vue # page for /user/feed route └── user-profile.vue # page for /user/profile route Our routes configuration (/src/router/routes.js) should look like this:export default [ &#123; path: '/user', // We point it to our component // where we defined our QLayout component: () =&gt; import('layouts/user'), // Now we define the sub-routes. // These are getting injected into // layout (from above) automatically // by using &lt;router-view&gt; placeholder // (need to specify it in layout) children: [ &#123; path: 'feed', component: () =&gt; import('pages/user-feed') &#125;, &#123; path: 'profile', component: () =&gt; import('pages/user-profile') &#125; ] &#125;] Please notice a few things: We are using lazy loading of layouts and pages (() =&gt; import(&lt;path&gt;)). If your website/app is small, then you can skip the lazy loading benefits as they could add more overhead than what it’s worth: import UserLayout from 'layouts/user'import UserFeed from 'pages/user-feed'import UserProfile from 'pages/user-profile'export default [ path: '/user', component: UserLayout, children: [ &#123; path: 'feed', component: UserFeed &#125;, &#123; path: 'profile', component: UserProfile &#125; ]] Quasar provides some out of the box Webpack aliases (‘layouts’ &amp; ‘pages’), which are used in the above examples. Pages of a Layout are declared as children of it in the Vue Router configuration so that &lt;router-view/&gt; will know what page component to inject. Remember to always use this Vue component whenever your Layout has pages attached to it. &lt;q-layout&gt; ... &lt;q-page-container&gt; &lt;!-- This is where your pages will get injected into your Layout --&gt; &lt;router-view /&gt; &lt;/q-page-container&gt; ...&lt;/q-layout&gt; Read all Vue Router documentation to fully understand the example above and how to configure the router and its routes for your app."},{"title":"Internationalization (I18n)","updated":"2018-03-13T19:49:52.342Z","permalink":"http://quasar-framework.org/components/internationalization.html","text":"Internationalization is a design process that ensures a product (a website or application) can be adapted to various languages and regions without requiring engineering changes to the source code. Think of internationalization as readiness for localization. Recommended package for handling website/app is vue-i18n. However, handling I18n in app-space is not enough. Quasar components have their own labels too. One option is to configure labels through label properties on each instance of Quasar components like QTable or QDatetime. This takes time and adds unnecessary complexity to your website/app. Instead, use the Quasar I18n (applies to Quasar components only!) system.

(quick overview of ES6 and full description – don’t worry, you don’t need to understand ALL of ES6). For devs experienced with reactive UIs, the Vue documentation itself takes half a day at most to read top-to-bottom and will help you understand how Quasar components can be used and configured. If you are a total beginner to Vue and reactive UI libraries and want a good tutorial, we recommend you take a look at the Udemy Course - Vue JS 2 - The Complete Guide. After reading the Vue documentation, let’s clear up some of the most frequently asked questions, like “How can I use Quasar components, Vue properties, methods and events”. Single File Vue ComponentsYou’ll be building your Quasar app using *.vue files which contain multiple sections: ‘template’ (HTML), ‘script’ (Javascript) and ‘style’ (CSS). &lt;template&gt; &lt;!-- you define your Vue template here --&gt;&lt;/template&gt;&lt;script&gt;// This is where your Javascript goes// to define your Vue component, which// can be a Layout, a Page or your own// component used throughout the app.export default &#123; //&#125;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;style&gt;/* This is where your CSS goes */&lt;/style&gt; CSS preprocessorsFor the &lt;style&gt; tag, you can also use whatever CSS preprocessor you want. Stylus is available out of the box. For SCSS/SASS or LESS, you’ll need to install their Webpack loaders (example: npm install less-loader). After installing the loader you need (remember Stylus is already installed for you), you can specify you want your chosen preprocessor to handle the CSS code you’re writing: &lt;!-- notice lang=\"stylus\" --&gt;&lt;style lang=\"stylus\"&gt;.some-div font-size 15px&lt;/style&gt; In the above example, you would replace stylus with the preprocessor you’ve chosen. Using Quasar DirectiveQuasar comes with a few custom Vue Directives. These directives can be applied on almost any DOM element or Component. Example of a Quasar directive:&lt;div v-ripple&gt;Click Me&lt;/div&gt; Notice how Ripple is used in the HTML template as v-ripple. Vue directives are prefixed with v-. In order for you to use any of the directives that Quasar supplies, you first need to tell Quasar you want it embedded. Open /quasar.conf.js file and add the following reference: framework: &#123; directives: ['Ripple']&#125; Let’s take another example. We now also want TouchPan and TouchSwipe directives, so we add them too in /quasar.conf.js:framework: &#123; directives: ['Ripple', 'TouchPan', 'TouchSwipe']&#125; Now we can write in your Vue files template: &lt;div v-touch-pan=\"handler\"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div v-touch-swipe=\"handler\"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div v-ripple&gt;Click me. I got ripples.&lt;/div&gt; Using Quasar ComponentsQuasar components have names beginning with “Q” like “QBtn” or “QElementResizeObservable”. In order to use them, you need to add a reference to them in /quasar.conf.js. Let’s take the following example with a QBtn and QIcon and then we’ll see how to embed these components in our app:&lt;div&gt; &lt;q-btn @click=\"doSomething\"&gt;Do something&lt;/q-btn&gt; &lt;q-icon name=\"alarm\" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt; Notice how QBtn is used in the Vue HTML template as &lt;q-btn&gt;. If we’d import QElementResizeObservable, then we’d use it in template as &lt;q-element-resize-observable&gt;. Now on /quasar.conf.js, you would add:framework: &#123; components: ['QBtn', 'QIcon']&#125; Using Quasar PluginsQuasar Plugins are features that you can use both in your Vue files as well as outside of them, like Notify, ActionSheet, AppVisibility and so on. In order to use them, you need to add a reference to them in /quasar.conf.js:framework: &#123; plugins: ['Notify', 'ActionSheet']&#125; Let’s take Notify as an example and see how we can then use it. In a Vue file, you’d write something like this:&lt;template&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;q-btn @click=\"$q.notify('My message')\" color=\"primary\" label=\"Show a notification\" /&gt; &lt;q-btn @click=\"showNotification\" color=\"primary\" label=\"Show another notification\" /&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/template&gt;&lt;script&gt;export default &#123; methods: &#123; showNotification () &#123; this.$q.notify('Some other message') &#125; &#125;&#125;&lt;/script&gt; Notice that in the template area we’re using $q.&lt;plugin-name&gt; and in our script we say this.$q.&lt;plugin-name&gt;. Now let’s see an example of Notify being used outside of a Vue file:import &#123; Notify &#125; from 'quasar'// ...Notify.create('My message') Importing All Components and Directives for Quick TestReferencing all Quasar Components, Directives and Plugins can be tiresome when you just want to do a quick test. In this case, you can tell Quasar to import them all by editing /quasar.conf.js like this: framework: 'all' IMPORTANTThis will not take advantage of tree shaking, causing your bundle to become bloated with unnescesary/unused code. Not recommended for production. Use this only for quick testing purposes. Self Closing TagsSome Quasar components do not need you to include HTML content inside of them. In this case, you can use them as self closing tags. One example with QIcon below: &lt;q-icon name=\"cloud\" /&gt; Self-closing means the above template is the equivalent to: &lt;q-icon name=\"cloud\"&gt;&lt;/q-icon&gt; Both forms are valid and can be used. It works the same with regular DOM elements: &lt;div class=\"col\" /&gt;&lt;!-- equivalent to: --&gt;&lt;div class=\"col\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; Some eslint-plugin-vue linting rules actually enforce using the self-closing syntax. Handling Vue PropertiesYou will notice throughout the documentation that Quasar components have a section called “Vue Properties”. These are often called Props in Vue documentation. Example: Vue Property Type Description infinite Boolean Infinite slides scrolling size String Thickness of loading bar. speed Number How fast should loading bar update its value (in milliseconds). columns Object Object defining columns (see “Columns Definition” below). offset Array Array with two numbers. Offset on horizontal and vertical (in pixels). Let’s take some examples with a bogus Quasar component (we will call it QBogus) that supports the properties above. We will discuss each of the types of Vue properties in the below sections. Boolean PropertyA boolean property means it only accepts a strictly Boolean value. The values will not be cast to Boolean, so you must ensure you are using a true Boolean. If you are trying to control that property and change it dynamically at runtime, then bind it to a variable in your scope:&lt;template&gt; &lt;q-bogus :infinite=\"myInfiniteVariable\" /&gt;&lt;/template&gt;&lt;script&gt;export default &#123; data () &#123; return &#123; myInfiniteVariable: false &#125; &#125;&#125;&lt;/script&gt; If, on the other hand, you know this Boolean value is not going to change, you can use the shorthand version of the variable like a component attribute and just specify it. In other words, if you don’t bind the variable to a variable in the component’s scope as it will always be true:&lt;template&gt; &lt;q-bogus infinite /&gt; &lt;!-- the following is perfectly valid, but it&apos;s a longer version --&gt; &lt;q-bogus :infinite=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;&lt;/template&gt; String PropertyAs you can imagine, Strings are required as a value for this type of property.&lt;template&gt; &lt;!-- direct assignment, no need for a variable in our scope --&gt; &lt;q-bogus size=\"24px\" /&gt; &lt;!-- we can also bind it to a variable in our scope so we can dynamically change it --&gt; &lt;q-bogus :size=\"mySize\" /&gt;&lt;/template&gt;&lt;script&gt;export default &#123; data () &#123; return &#123; // notice String as value mySize: '16px' &#125; &#125;&#125;&lt;/script&gt; Number Property&lt;template&gt; &lt;!-- Case 1. Direct assignment. Notice the colon (\":\") before property name. --&gt; &lt;q-bogus :speed=\"50\" /&gt; &lt;!-- Case 2. Assignment through a scope variable --&gt; &lt;q-bogus :speed=\"myNumber\" /&gt;&lt;/template&gt;&lt;script&gt;export default &#123; data () &#123; return &#123; // notice Number as value myNumber: 50 &#125; &#125;&#125;&lt;/script&gt; Object Property&lt;template&gt; &lt;!-- Case 1. Direct assignment. --&gt; &lt;q-bogus :columns=\"&#123;key: 'value', anotherKey: 'another value'&#125;\" /&gt; &lt;!-- or a more elegant way for Case 1: --&gt; &lt;q-bogus :columns=\"&#123; key: 'value', anotherKey: 'another value' &#125;\" /&gt; &lt;!-- Case 2. Assignment through a scope variable --&gt; &lt;q-bogus :columns=\"myColumns\" /&gt;&lt;/template&gt;&lt;script&gt;export default &#123; data () &#123; return &#123; myColumns: &#123; key: 'value', anotherKey: 'another value' &#125; &#125; &#125;&#125;&lt;/script&gt; Array Property&lt;template&gt; &lt;!-- Case 1. Direct assignment. --&gt; &lt;q-bogus :offset=\"[10, 20]\" /&gt; &lt;!-- Case 2. Assignment through a scope variable --&gt; &lt;q-bogus :offset=\"myOffset\" /&gt;&lt;/template&gt;&lt;script&gt;export default &#123; data () &#123; return &#123; myOffset: [10, 20] &#125; &#125;&#125;&lt;/script&gt; Handling Vue MethodsYou will notice throughout the documentation that some Quasar components have a section called “Vue Methods”. Example: Vue Method Description next() Goes to next slide. previous(doneFn) Goes to previous slide. toggleFullscreen() Toggles fullscreen mode. In order for you to access these methods, you will need to set a Vue reference on the component first. Here’s an example: &lt;template&gt; &lt;!-- Notice ref=\"myRef\". We will use the name assigned to \"ref\" in the script part below --&gt; &lt;q-bogus ref=\"myRef\" /&gt;&lt;/template&gt;&lt;script&gt;export default &#123; // we can now access `this.$refs.myRef` // an example on the mounted() Vue component hook mounted () &#123; // calling \"next()\" method: this.$refs.myRef.next() &#125; // calling before mount point might result in errors // as Vue hasn't yet prepared the Vue references&#125;&lt;/script&gt; Handling Vue EventsYou will notice throughout the documentation that some Quasar components have a section called “Vue Events”. Do not confuse these Vue events with the Global Event Bus as these two have nothing in common. Example of “Vue Events” section in docs: Event Name Description @open Triggered right after the Modal is opened. @close Triggered right after the Modal is closed. In order for you to catch these events, when they are triggered, you will need to add listeners for them on the component itself in the HTML template. Here’s an example: &lt;template&gt; &lt;q-bogus @open=\"doSomething\" @close=\"doSomethingElse\" /&gt;&lt;/template&gt;&lt;script&gt;export default &#123; methods: &#123; doSomething () &#123; // this method has been called (in this case) // because @open event was triggered by QBogus component &#125;, doSomethingElse () &#123; // this method has been called (in this case) // because @close event was triggered by QBogus component &#125; &#125;&#125;&lt;/script&gt; There are times when you need to access native DOM events on a Quasar component too, like the native @click. Do not confuse native events with the Vue events emitted by the component. They are different things. Let’s take an example: let’s say we have a component (QBogus) that emits @open and @close, but doesn’t emit a @click event. @click being a native DOM event, we can still catch it with the .native modifier: &lt;!-- Notice \"@click.native\" --&gt;&lt;q-bogus @click.native=\"myMethod\" /&gt;"},{"title":"JS Animations","updated":"2018-02-21T21:16:36.638Z","permalink":"http://quasar-framework.org/components/js-animations.html","text":"You can create animations through Javascript (using RAF - requestAnimationFrame()) with Quasar. import &#123; animate &#125; from 'quasar'let id = animate.start(&#123; name: 'unique-animation-name', // optional, if none is supplied a unique one is created and returned from: '0', // current position to: '100', // final position duration: 300, // duration of the animation done (finalPosition) &#123;...&#125;, // function to call when animation is done cancel (currentPosition) &#123;...&#125;, // function to call when animation is aborted apply (currentPosition) &#123;...&#125;, // function called on each step so you can apply changes easing (currentPosition) &#123; // custom easing function, see below // ...return transformation of currentPosition... &#125;&#125;)// Starting an animation with same name will abort the previous one// Stop an animation using its nameanimate.stop('unique-animation-name')// oranimate.stop(id) // id returned from above Example:import &#123; animate &#125; from 'quasar'animate.start(&#123; from: 6, to: 158, apply (pos) &#123; el.style.maxHeight = `$&#123;pos&#125;px` &#125;, done () &#123; console.log(`we're done!`) &#125;&#125;) Easing FunctionsEasing functions take the current percent progress of the animation (a float between 0 and 1) and return a position multiplier (0 being initial position and 1 being final position).

This is part of the smart responsiveness designed into Quasar’s layout component. If you’d like to control how the left and right side / drawers work, you have a prop called breakpoint on each QLayoutDrawer. This value represents the minimum size of the screen in pixels, before the Drawer is forced to float above the Layout. This is a fantastic and important function in maximizing screen real estate for smaller devices. TipAlso take a look at the behavior property if you want the Drawer to act only as on a narrow screen or only as on a wide screen, effectively disable the breakpoint. Using v-modelThere’s the possibility to use v-model to control the state of Drawer (opened/showing and closed/hidden). &lt;template&gt; ... &lt;q-layout-drawer v-model=\"drawer\"&gt; ... &lt;/q-layout-drawer&gt; ... &lt;q-btn @click=\"drawer = !drawer\" flat round dense icon=\"menu\" /&gt; ...&lt;/template&gt;&lt;script&gt;export default &#123; data () &#123; return &#123; // \"false\" means hidden // \"true\" means visible drawer: true &#125; &#125;&#125;&lt;/script&gt; Please note that the model can instantly get changed upon Drawer being rendered if the breakpoint requires it."},{"title":"Layout Header & Footer","updated":"2018-03-03T16:04:29.487Z","permalink":"http://quasar-framework.org/components/layout-header-and-footer.html","text":"QLayout allows you to configure your views as a 3x3 matrix, containing an optional Header and/or Footer.

Reveal PropertyYou’ll notice in playing with the QLayout view configuration that if you set the header to “hhh” (all small letters), the header will be set to a static position at the top of the page. This in turn means, the header will move off the screen as the user scrolls down the page. If the user then needs to use the navigation in the header, he/she must scroll completely up to top of the page to get to it and this is bad UX. One way to help the user is to add a back-to-top button on the page. Another way is to use the reveal prop. The reveal prop overrides “H” in QLayout view prop, by fixing the header to the top of the screen. As the user scrolls down more than reveal-offset pixels, the header rolls up it’s own height above the top of the screen. As soon as the user scrolls back up (just 1 pixel), the header comes into view again immediately. Same goes for QLayoutFooter. Hiding Header/Footer CompletelyQLayoutHeader and QLayoutFooter support a Boolean v-model which determines if they take up space on screen or not. This does not interferes with the reveal property, which works only if the v-model is set to true. &lt;template&gt; ... &lt;q-layout-header v-model=\"state\"&gt; ... &lt;/q-layout-header&gt; ...&lt;/template&gt;&lt;script&gt;export default &#123; data () &#123; return &#123; state: true &#125; &#125;, methods: &#123; toggleHeader () &#123; this.state = !this.state &#125; &#125;&#125;&lt;/script&gt; QLayoutHeader/QLayoutFooter Vue Events Vue Event Description @reveal(state) Emitted when reveal state changes.

You cannot use CSS margins as a style neither on QLayout itself nor on any of the components mentioned above. However use can safely use CSS padding. RoutingIf your layout uses Vue Router sub-routes (recommended), then it makes sense to use Vue’s &lt;router-view /&gt; component, which is just a placeholder where sub-routes are injected. Toolbar PlacementA great place to use the Toolbars component is within the QLayoutHeader and QLayoutFooter. &lt;q-layout-header&gt; &lt;q-toolbar color=\"green\"&gt; ... toolbar content ... &lt;/q-toolbar&gt;&lt;/q-layout-header&gt; Search exampleBelow is an example of placing a Search bar in the header:&lt;q-layout&gt; ... &lt;!-- We place it on header --&gt; &lt;q-layout-header&gt; &lt;q-toolbar color=\"primary\"&gt; &lt;q-search inverted v-model=\"search\" color=\"none\" /&gt; &lt;/q-toolbar&gt; &lt;/q-layout-header&gt; ...&lt;/q-layout&gt; Fixed Positioning &amp; FABsAlso, read about the smart Page Sticky which helps you fix position DOM elements or components on a Layout page and learn how you can use it to also place a Floating Action Button. QLayout Vue Properties Vue Property Type Description view String Configuration string which defines how different parts of the layout get displayed on screen. Configuring the “view” propQuasar introduces a unique and excellent layout concept, which allows you to easily structure layouts to work in certain ways, by simply changing a short string notation. To explain how this works, imagine your Layout is a 3x3 matrix of containers. The first row of containers would be the header and the last row would be the footer. The first column of containers would be the “left” and last column would be the “right”. The center of the matrix, below the header and above the footer, would be the page or main content container. Now think about this. This matrix of containers or “QLayout View” can be represented by a string. This string contains only 11 characters: 3 defining the header row then a space 3 defining the middle row a space then 3 defining the footer The picture below offers a visual representation of the QLayout View, to help you understand how to configure its 3x3 matrix. The letters shown above are also case sensitive. For example, using at least one “L” (uppercase character instead of lowercase) will make your layout left side (drawer) be in a fixed position. Same applies for “H” (header), “F” (footer) and finally “R” (right side / drawer). For example, if you want your layout’s right side / drawer to be placed on the right of the header, page and footer, you’d use hhr lpr ffr. If you’d like to also make it fixed, just transform one r character to uppercase, like this: hhR lpr ffr, or hhr lpR ffr or hhr lpr ffR. These settings are completely up to you to use as you’d like. You could even go wild with a setup like this: Lhh lpR ffr. Try it out! Make sure you also go to the desktop view, to see it work properly. NOTEIt is important that you specify all sections of a layout, even if you don’t use them. For example, even if you don’t use footer or right side drawer, specify them within your layout’s view prop.

They are best suited for displaying similar data types as rows of information, such as a contact list, a playlist, or menu. Each row is called an Item. Items can also be used outside of a List. Lists can encapsulate Items or Item-like components, for example QCollapsible. List Items have following content areas: left side and right side (usually equipped for supplemental actions represented by icons, avatars, images or letters, but not limited to only these) main content which usually is filled with a label (title) and sublabel (subtitle), form components, or anything else for that matter.

Due to how Webpack works in creating the bundle for your App, in some cases you may need to use QItemTile, like for avatars or images. The reason is simple: if you use QItemSide avatar property, you must supply the path to the statics folder and cannot use the assets folder or relative paths. Instead, the latter two can be used with a QItemTile wrapping an &lt;img&gt; HTML tag. Look closely at image paths in the example above (statics/guy-avatar.png vs ~assets/boy-avatar.png). Also read about App Handling Static Assets to understand how Webpack includes assets into the bundle. ComponentsBelow is a list of Quasar components that you can use to define lists and list items: QList (encapsulating QItems and all other List related components) QListHeader (header of a section in QList) QItemSeparator (external Item separator/separator) QItem (encapsulating everything an Item contains) QItemSide (left or right side) QItemMain (for main content of an Item) QItemTile (for individual parts of QItemSide and QItemMain, like label, icon, avatar, image, …) QListQList encapsulates all other components mentioned. It’s not mandatory, but does help with maintaining a good design and can also define some properties that will be applied to all QItems (or QItem-like components) like multiline, separator, link, highlight and so on.

It will take care of the quirks involved when running under Cordova or on a browser, including notifying the user he/she has to acknowledge opening popups. Debounce FunctionIf your App uses JavaScript to accomplish taxing tasks, a debounce function is essential to ensuring a given task doesn’t fire so often that it bricks browser performance. Debouncing a function limits the rate at which the function can fire. Debouncing enforces that a function not be called again until a certain amount of time has passed without it being called. As in “execute this function only if 100 milliseconds have passed without it being called.” A quick example: you have a resize listener on the window which does some element dimension calculations and (possibly) repositions a few elements. That isn’t a heavy task in itself but being repeatedly fired after numerous resizes will really slow your App down. So why not limit the rate at which the function can fire? // Returns a function, that, as long as it continues to be invoked, will not// be triggered. The function will be called after it stops being called for// N milliseconds. If `immediate` is passed, trigger the function on the// leading edge, instead of the trailing.import &#123; debounce &#125; from 'quasar'(Debounced Function) debounce(Function fn, Number milliseconds_to_wait, Boolean immediate)// Example:window.addEventListener( 'resize', debounce(function() &#123; .... things to do ... &#125;, 300 /*ms to wait*/)) There’s also a frameDebounce available which delays calling your function until next browser frame is scheduled to run (read about requestAnimationFrame). import &#123; frameDebounce &#125; from 'quasar'(Debounced Function) frameDebounce(Function fn)// Example:window.addEventListener( 'resize', frameDebounce(function() &#123; .... things to do ... &#125;)) Throttle FunctionThrottling enforces a maximum number of times a function can be called over time. As in “execute this function at most once every 300 milliseconds.” // Returns a function, that, as long as it continues to be invoked, will not// be triggered. The function will be called after it stops being called for// N milliseconds. If `immediate` is passed, trigger the function on the// leading edge, instead of the trailing.import &#123; throttle &#125; from 'quasar'(Throttled Function) throttle(Function fn, Number limit_in_milliseconds)// Example:window.addEventListener( 'resize', throttle(function() &#123; .... things to do ... &#125;, 300 /* execute at most once every 0.3s */)) (Deep) Copy ObjectsA basic respawn of jQuery.extend().

A good example of this would be a “Back to top” button, which would first appear at the bottom of the screen, once the user scrolls down to a certain level on the screen. The great advantage of this is that the elements wrapped by this component will never overlap the layout header, footer or left/right sides, even if those are not configured to be fixed. In the latter case, the position will be offsetted so that the overlap won’t occur.Try it out with a non fixed footer for example.

After image has loaded, you can also display some content on top of the Parallax image (in the example above an &lt;h1&gt; tag). Vue Properties Param Attributes Type Description src String Source for the image. height Number Height of Parallax in pixels. Default value is 500. speed Number Float between 0 and 1. Example:&lt;!-- VueModel contains data property \"imageURL\" --&gt;&lt;q-parallax :src=\"imageURL\" :height=\"300\"&gt; &lt;div slot=\"loading\"&gt;Loading...&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Parallax&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/q-parallax&gt;"},{"title":"Platform Detection","updated":"2018-02-21T21:16:36.647Z","permalink":"http://quasar-framework.org/components/platform-detection.html","text":"Helpers are built-in to detect the Platform (and its capabilities) in which the code is running: // For usage inside a Vue component JS:this.$q.platform.is.mobile// or usage inside a Vue component template:$q.platform.is.cordova// Only for usage outside a Vue component you need to import it:import &#123; Platform &#125; from 'quasar' Property Type Meaning Platform.is.mobile boolean Is the code running on a mobile device?

You need Quasar v0.15.5+. Enabling RTL supportTo enable it, you need to edit /quasar.conf.js:build: &#123; rtl: true&#125; How it worksRTL is tightly coupled to Quasar I18n. When Quasar is set to use an RTL language (language pack has “rtl” prop set to “true”) and RTL support is enabled (check step above for quasar.conf.js), then the UI will dynamically transform Quasar &amp; your website/app code for RTL. Let’s discuss about each of these two requirements: Quasar needs to be set to use an RTL languageSee Internationalization on how you can set a language. You can set a language as default or dynamically set one. RTL support needs to be enabledYou need to set “rtl” to “true” under quasar.conf.js &gt; “build”. What this does is it compiles CSS for both your website/app code and for Quasar components and add corresponding RTL CSS rules automatically. Your CSS bundle will slightly increase in size due to the addition of these CSS rules. Things to keep in mind Both RTL and non-RTL Quasar language packs will work together and dynamically switch to/from RTL. So only choosing an RTL Quasar language pack will trigger the RTL UI for you. You don’t need separate builds of your app (one for non-RTL and one for RTL-only). The RTL is dynamical. You can dynamically detect if you are on RTL mode by taking a look at Boolean this.$q.i18n.rtl. More info on Vue Prototype Injections. You need to be careful when writing your own CSS. Like mentioned above, Quasar will automatically add RTL rules based on your CSS code. So writing: .my-class &#123; margin-left: 10px; right: 5px;&#125; …will add this rule for RTL: [dir=rtl] .my-class &#123; margin-right: 10px; left: 5px;&#125; Any CSS rule that refers to “left” or “right” is automatically triggering an equivalent RTL CSS rule to be added. Marking CSS rules as exceptionsIf you need an exception so your CSS code will not add a corresponding RTL rule, then add this comment:.my-class &#123; margin-left: 10px /* rtl:ignore */;&#125; Now both RTL and non-RTL UI mode will have margin-left prop. Sometimes you’ll need to make exceptions for whole DOM elements / components. In this case, add dir=&quot;ltr&quot; or dir=&quot;rtl&quot; HTML attribute to the outermost DOM element / component template: &lt;div dir=\"ltr\"&gt; &lt;!-- this DIV and all its content will use RTL mode regardless of Quasar language pack RTL settings --&gt;&lt;/div&gt; Or, if you need your RTL UI to use left-to-right (ltr) mode for a DOM element / component:&lt;div dir=\"ltr\"&gt; &lt;!-- this DIV and all its content will use non-RTL mode regardless of Quasar language pack RTL settings --&gt;&lt;/div&gt; Handling Quasar UMDTo enable RTL UIs in UMD you need to include the RTL equivalent CSS tag for your Quasar version and also pack in a Quasar RTL language pack (like Hebrew or Farsi). Example: &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; ... &lt;link href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/quasar-framework@latest/dist/umd/quasar.mat.rtl.min.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\"&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; ... &lt;!-- we also need an RTL Quasar language pack; let's take Hebrew as example; include this after Quasar JS tag --&gt; &lt;script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/quasar-framework@latest/dist/umd/i18n.he.umd.min.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;script&gt; Quasar.i18n.set(Quasar.i18n.he) &lt;/script&gt; &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt; Check what tags you need to include in your HTML files by generating a sample with $ vue init quasarframework/quasar-starter-kit-umd &lt;folder&gt; and answering with “Yes” to the RTL question and specifying an RTL language for Quasar I18n.Also notice the &lt;html dir=&quot;rtl&quot;&gt; tag at the beginning of the generated html file – you’ll need that too. CaveatQuasar CLI automatically adds equivalent RTL CSS rules for your website/app code, but this is not the case for UMD where Quasar CLI is not being used.

Think of it as a DOM element which has overflow: auto, but with your own custom styled scrollbar instead of browser’s default one and a few nice features on top. This is especially useful for desktop as scrollbars are hidden on a mobile device. When on a mobile device, QScrollArea simply wraps the content in a &lt;div&gt; configured for default browser scrolling. InstallationEdit /quasar.conf.js:framework: &#123; components: ['QScrollArea']&#125; Basic UsageQScrollArea supports scrolling by user dragging the custom scrollbars or by using the mousewheel.

If none is found, then it considers that the scrolling takes place on the document itself. Components like QScrollArea, for example, respect this design and have the scroll class embedded into it, so that QScrollObservable (or any other scrolling component or directive) can succesfully detect it and attach the necessary event handlers to it. Please note that simply attaching scroll CSS class to a DOM element or on a Vue component will have no effect if the respective element is not overflowed (example, with: CSS overflow: hidden and a height smaller than its inner content height). Example of good container:&lt;!-- Quasar CSS helper 'overflow-hidden' is equivalent to style=\"overflow: hidden\"--&gt;&lt;div class=\"scroll overflow-hidden\" style=\"height: 100px\"&gt; ...content expanding over the 100px height from container... &lt;q-scroll-observable @scroll=\"scrollHandler\" /&gt; &lt;!-- example with `v-scroll` directive --&gt; &lt;div v-scroll=\"scrollHandler\"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; One more example with QScrollArea:&lt;q-scroll-area style=\"width: 400px; height: 500px;\" class=\"bg-yellow\"&gt; ...content expanding over the 500px height from container... &lt;q-scroll-observable @scroll=\"scrollHandler\" /&gt;&lt;/q-scroll-area&gt; Layout ScrollingWhen scrolling on a Layout with a Page, rather than injecting a QScrollObservable (and by so doing registering additional scroll events) you can take advantage of QLayout´s @scroll event directly on your component defining the Layout. &lt;q-layout @scroll=\"scrollHandler\"&gt;...&lt;/q-layout&gt;"},{"title":"Scrolling Utils","updated":"2018-03-17T17:48:38.129Z","permalink":"http://quasar-framework.org/components/scrolling-utils.html","text":"Determine Scrolling ContainerMight be worthwhile to read how this is done hereimport &#123; scroll &#125; from 'quasar'const &#123; getScrollTarget &#125; = scroll// Get parent DomNode that handles page scrolling// Usually this is element with classname \".layout-view\" or \"window\"(DOM Element) getScrollTarget(DomElement) Get/Set Scroll Positionimport &#123; scroll &#125; from 'quasar'const &#123; getScrollPosition, setScrollPosition &#125; = scroll// Get scroll position of a element or page.

Vue Events Vue Event Description @input(newVal) Triggered immediately on model value change. @change(newVal) Triggered on lazy model value change. @focus Triggered on focus. @blur Triggered a blur. @keydown Triggered by keydown event on textfield. @keyup Triggered by keyup event on textfield. @click Triggered by a native click event on textfield. ColoringUse the color prop with one of the Quasar colors from the Color Palette, like primary, secondary, orange-7, teal-2: &lt;q-search color=\"orange\" v-model=\"search\" /&gt; Use the inverted prop, to change the background of the input to the color. &lt;q-search inverted color=\"orange\" v-model=\"search\" /&gt; Error StateUse the error prop to show there has been an error.

One is for the basic component. The other is with the QField component. Both methods offer “inverted” coloring. Additional Vue Properties Property Type Description color String The color the QInput should have. The default is primary. inverted Boolean Set to true, to color field’s background set by the color prop. dark Boolean Set to true, if the field is on a dark background. It will invert the text color to make it light. align Text Controls the ‘right’, ‘center’ or ‘left’ alignment of the input. The default is ‘left’. Basic Formatting ExamplesThis will color the field black. &lt;q-search v-model=\"text\" float-label=\"Colored\" color=\"black\" /&gt; This will show an inverted colored input field in amber. Here, the text is automatically inverted to a lighter color. &lt;q-search v-model=\"text\" inverted color=\"amber\" stack-label=\"Amber Colored Background\" /&gt; AlignmentYou can also align the input to the right, center or left. The default is left. The below example will show a field for Euro currency input. &lt;!-- Align textfield content to the right --&gt;&lt;q-search v-model=\"text\" align=\"right\" /&gt; Basic Usage with QFieldIt is also possible to further enhance a QInput by wrapping it in a QField component. &lt;div class=\"bg-grey-9\" style=\"width: 500px; padding: 25px\"&gt; &lt;q-field icon=\"wifi\" label=\"Some Label\" :count=\"10\" helper=\"Some helper\" :error=\"error\" error-label=\"Some error\" &gt; &lt;q-search v-model=\"text\" dark inverted color=\"black\" float-label=\"Textfield\" /&gt; &lt;/q-field&gt;&lt;/div&gt; The above usage of QField will show the input field within a dark grey background with an inverse white text.

Default is the “check” icon. selected-icon String, Boolean Used to change the icon, when a Step is selected. Default is the “edit” icon. error-icon String / Boolean Used to change the icon, when there is an error in a Step. Default is the “warning” icon. You can also control the current step by using v-model on QStep. More details in next section. Vue Method Description goToStep(String) Moves the user to the given Step, defined by Step’s “name” property. next() Stepper goes to the next step. previous() Stepper goes to the previous step. reset() Returns the stepper back to the first step. Using v-modelEach QStep has a name prop (which is optional). Use this prop along with v-model to control the current step. The example below shows how you can use v-model alone to control navigation. Notice the @click events. If you dynamically insert/remove Steps it’s better to use a Vue reference on QStepper and call next() or previous() methods since these methods are not binded to specific Step names. &lt;template&gt; &lt;q-stepper v-model=\"currentStep\"&gt; &lt;q-step name=\"first\"&gt; ... &lt;q-stepper-navigation&gt; &lt;q-btn color=\"primary\" @click=\"currentStep = 'second'\" label=\"Go to Step 2\" /&gt; &lt;/q-stepper-navigation&gt; &lt;/q-step&gt; &lt;q-step name=\"second\"&gt; ... &lt;q-stepper-navigation&gt; &lt;q-btn color=\"primary\" @click=\"currentStep = 'first'\" label=\"Go Back\" /&gt; &lt;/q-stepper-navigation&gt; &lt;/q-step&gt; &lt;/q-stepper&gt;&lt;/template&gt;&lt;script&gt;export default &#123; data () &#123; return &#123; // we initialize it with first step's name currentStep: 'first' &#125; &#125;&#125;&lt;/script&gt; QStep (Child) Vue Property Type Description name Number, String Step name, used by QStepper’s v-model or goToStep() method. default Boolean (Optional) Use it on only one Step. Becomes default selected one. error Boolean Mark Step as having an error. default Boolean Use on only one Step to make it be the active one by default. Previous steps will be marked as done. Useful when refreshing page. title String Step title. subtitle String Step’s additional information along the title. icon String Step’s icon when Step isn’t finished yet. If no active-icon is specified, then this icon will be used when Step is currently active too. active-icon String The icon used for the Step when it’s currently active. Defaults to icon prop value when active-icon isn’t specified. done-icon String The icon to use for Step when it’s finished. error-icon String The icon to use for Step when it’s marked as having an error. disable Boolean Step is disabled. Methods for this component: Vue Method Description select() Stepper selects this step as current one. QStepperNavigation (Child of QStepper or QStep)This component allows you to place buttons within QStepper or QStep to navigate through the steps. It is up to you to add whatever buttons you require. &lt;q-stepper ref=\"myStepper\"&gt; ... &lt;q-stepper-navigation&gt; &lt;q-btn color=\"secondary\" @click=\"$refs.myStepper.next()\" label=\"Next\" /&gt; &lt;q-btn color=\"secondary\" @click=\"$refs.myStepper.previous()\" label=\"Back\" /&gt; &lt;/q-stepper-navigation&gt;&lt;/q-stepper&gt; More ExamplesVertical StepperIt is also possible to build a stepper, which presents itself in a vertical fashion. To do this, simply use vertical property on QStepper: &lt;q-stepper vertical&gt; &lt;q-step&gt;..&lt;/q-step&gt; &lt;q-step&gt;..&lt;/q-step&gt; ...&lt;/q-stepper&gt; When using a vertical Stepper, it doesn’t really make sense to use a “global” QStepper navigation. Instead, use navigation within each QStep. Displaying ProgressA common case is where you need to take an asynchronouse action (like an Ajax call) before going to next step. Make use of QInnerLoading component for this: &lt;q-stepper&gt; &lt;!-- Steps... --&gt; ........ &lt;!-- Create a Boolean scope variable (here it's \"inProgress\") and binded to \"visible\" prop. Then toggle it whenever you need to display that the Stepper has a background process going. --&gt; &lt;q-inner-loading :visible=\"inProgress\" /&gt;&lt;/q-stepper&gt; Specific Steps OrderIf you dynamically add/remove Steps, then you need to specify the order property (for ALL QSteps) so that the Stepper will know the actual order of Steps. By using v-if or v-for directives, Vue &amp; Quasar can’t ensure Steps will be registered in the order they are placed in DOM. IMPORTANTJust make sure that when you use order you apply it to all QSteps and don’t leave out any step without it. Either use order for all QSteps or don’t use it at all. &lt;q-stepper&gt; &lt;!-- Will come as second step --&gt; &lt;q-step :order=\"2\"&gt;..&lt;/q-step&gt; &lt;!-- Will come as first step --&gt; &lt;q-step :order=\"1\"&gt;..&lt;/q-step&gt; &lt;!-- Will come as third step --&gt; &lt;q-step :order=\"3\"&gt;..&lt;/q-step&gt;&lt;/q-stepper&gt; The order property applied to all QStep doesn’t has to be strictly growing consecutively. Setting order as 10, 100 and 52 will work too."},{"title":"Stylus Variables","updated":"2018-02-21T21:16:36.656Z","permalink":"http://quasar-framework.org/components/stylus-variables.html","text":"Quasar CSS is a blank slate that you can easily customize and modify to fit your brand, while still following the standards of each platform.

There is also the ability to use Vue Router for each tab instead of targeting a QTabPane. Also, QTabPanes are optional and you can use v-model on QTabs. We’ll cover those features later. The name prop on QTab and QTabPane links the tab to the targets (panes). As you can see from the example, we have a main Tab container with (QTabs) and singular Tabs themselves with (QTab). Let’s look at the Tabs container first: QTabs (Container Component)Use the QTabs component to wrap your Tabs. Vue Properties Vue Property Type Description align String The type of the alignment for the tabs within the tabs container. The allowed values are left (default), center, right or justify. position String The screen position of the tabs. The allowed values are top or bottom. color String A Quasar standard CSS color. text-color String (Quasar v0.15.7+) One from Quasar Palette to override color of text inverted Boolean Set to true, to invert the tab color. two-lines Boolean Set to true, should a tab’s label wrap to a second line. no-pane-border Boolean Avoid drawing a border around QTabPanes. glossy Boolean Apply a glossy effect There is support for v-model (which is optional). In this case, you need a Vue variable in your scope which will contain the name of the current selected tab (through name prop on QTab). Changing the value will also make QTabs select the according QTab. Basic usage with v-model:&lt;template&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;q-tabs v-model=\"selectedTab\"&gt; &lt;q-tab slot=\"title\" name=\"tab-1\" icon=\"message\" /&gt; &lt;q-tab slot=\"title\" name=\"tab-2\" icon=\"fingerprint\" /&gt; &lt;q-tab slot=\"title\" name=\"tab-3\" icon=\"account_box\" /&gt; ...optional `QTabPane`s... &lt;/q-tabs&gt; &lt;q-btn @click=\"selectThirdTab\"&gt;Select Third Tab&lt;/q-btn&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/template&gt;&lt;script&gt;import &#123; QTabs, QTab, QBtn &#125; from 'quasar'export default &#123; components: &#123; QTabs, QTab, QBtn &#125;, data () &#123; return &#123; // initializing for second tab to be selected by default selectedTab: 'tab-2' &#125; &#125;, methods: &#123; selectThirdTab () &#123; // we select third tab which has `name` set to 'tab-3' this.selectedTab = 'tab-3' &#125; &#125;&#125;&lt;/script&gt; Vue Methods Vue Method Description selectTab(name) Set the active Tab using its name. Vue Events Event Description @select Triggered when selected Tab changes. Overflow BehaviorOn a desktop, if the Tabs cannot be dispalayed completely, the user will be offered a scroll action in the form of an opaque gradient fill. When hovered over, it turns to an arrow button. The user can press continually on the button, and the unseen Tabs will scroll by. If the user is on a device with a small screen (like a phone) and all Tabs can fit on the screen, they will be automatically justify aligned and share the complete screen width. If the Tabs do not fit, then the user will also see the arrow to indicate the user can swipe through the Tabs. QTab (Child Component)QTab component is used to define a title for your Tab. Can be linked to a QTabPane through name prop.If you want to use Vue Router with a Tab (clicking on a Tab triggers a route change in your app), then please refer to QRouteTab component in next section. IMPORTANT. Do not forget to specify slot=&quot;title&quot; on QTab. Vue Properties Vue Property Type Description default Boolean Set to true on the tab which you want to be selected by default. label String Label to use for the tab. icon String Icon to use for the tab. disable Boolean If disabled, the user won’t be able to select the tab. hidden Boolean If set to true, it hides the tab. hide String Possible values: icon or label. On narrow screens one of the two will be hidden. name String The id of the tab. Default is a uid added by Quasar. alert Boolean When true, the tab has a red dot, which is meant to get the user’s attention. count Number, String A number to indicate there is a list of unread or unseen items in the tab’s content. color String The color of the tab’s icon or text, should it be different than the default. Vue Methods Vue Method Description select() Make this Tab the selected one. Vue Events Event Description @select Triggered when QTab gets selected. @click Triggered when user clicks/taps on Tab. Usage with “v-model”Best way to programmatically switch between Tabs is by using a v-model. Here’s another example, a little bit more complex which includes a QSelect to explain the effects of using a v-model. &lt;q-select type=\"radio\" v-model=\"tabsModel\" :options=\"tabsOptions\"&gt;&lt;/q-select&gt;&lt;q-tabs v-model=\"tabsModel\"&gt; &lt;q-tab name=\"xtab-1\" icon=\"message\" slot=\"title\" /&gt; &lt;q-tab name=\"xtab-2\" icon=\"account_box\" slot=\"title\" /&gt; &lt;q-tab name=\"xtab-3\" icon=\"mail\" slot=\"title\" /&gt; &lt;q-tab-pane name=\"xtab-1\"&gt;Tab One&lt;/q-tab-pane&gt; &lt;q-tab-pane name=\"xtab-2\"&gt;Tab Two&lt;/q-tab-pane&gt; &lt;q-tab-pane name=\"xtab-3\"&gt;Tab Three&lt;/q-tab-pane&gt;&lt;/q-tabs&gt; // Data for template abovedata () &#123; return &#123; tabsModel: 'xtab-2', tabsOptions: [ &#123;label: 'Tab 1', value: 'xtab-1'&#125;, &#123;label: 'Tab 2', value: 'xtab-2'&#125;, &#123;label: 'Tab 3', value: 'xtab-3'&#125; ] &#125;&#125; NoteWhen the tabs are initially rendered, the value stored in the v-model used by your component, as with tabsModel above, will also indicate to the user a selected tab. If you aren’t using v-model, you can set the initially active tab with the default prop. QTabPane (Child Component)The Tabs Pane component is useful, when the content of each tab is relatively small or simple. If you have complex content, you’ll propably want to use the Tabs Router Component below. Vue Properties Vue Property Type Description name String Required The name of the tab and also the target id. keep-alive Boolean Keeps components alive even if current selected Tab changes. In order to show the proper content for each tab in each pane, the names of the tabs and panes should match. QRouteTab (Child Component)The Tabs Router component is just like the QTab component and shares the same properties, however it also has Vue Router properties bound to it. These allow the triggering of your specific routing. Additional Vue Router Properties.

Selection vs Ticking, Expansion Selection (through QTree selected prop) refers to the currently selected node (gets highlighted with different background). Ticking (through QTree ticked prop) refers to the checkbox associated with each node. Expansion (through QTree expanded prop) refers to the nodes that are expanded. All properties above require the .sync modifier in order for them to work correctly. Example:&lt;!-- DO NOT forget about adding \".sync\" --&gt;&lt;q-tree selected.sync=\"selection\" ... Tick StrategyThere are three ticking strategy: ‘leaf’, ‘leaf-filtered’, ‘strict’ with an additional (and default) ‘none’ which disables ticking. Strategy Description leaf Ticked nodes are only the leaves. Ticking a node influences the parent’s ticked state too (parent becomes partially ticked or ticked), as well as its children (all tickable children become ticked). leaf-filtered Same concept as leaf, only that this strategy applies only to filtered nodes (the nodes that remain visible after filtering). strict Ticked nodes are independent of parent or children tick state. You can apply a global tick strategy for a QTree and locally change the ticking strategy for a certain node by specifying the tickStrategy in the nodes model. Custom Filter MethodYou can customize the filtering method by specifying the filter-method prop. The method below is actually the default filtering strategy:&lt;template&gt; &lt;q-tree :filter-method=\"myFilterMethod\" ...&gt;&lt;/template&gt;&lt;script&gt;export default &#123; methods: &#123; myFilterMethod (node, filter) &#123; const filt = filter.toLowerCase() return node.label &amp;&amp; node.label.toLowerCase().indexOf(filt) &gt; -1 &#125; &#125;&#125;&lt;/script&gt; ExamplesNode icon/avatar/image, controlling expansion and colored&lt;template&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;q-btn color=\"secondary\" @click=\"togglePropsGoodServiceExpand\" label=\"Toggle 'Good service' expansion\" /&gt; &lt;q-tree :nodes=\"props\" :expanded.sync=\"propsExpanded\" color=\"red\" node-key=\"label\" /&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/template&gt;&lt;script&gt;export default &#123; data: () =&gt; (&#123; propsExpanded: ['Satisfied customers', 'Pleasant surroundings'], props: [ &#123; label: 'Satisfied customers', avatar: 'statics/boy-avatar.png', children: [ &#123; label: 'Good food', icon: 'restaurant_menu', children: [ &#123; label: 'Quality ingredients' &#125;, &#123; label: 'Good recipe' &#125; ] &#125;, &#123; label: 'Good service', icon: 'room_service', children: [ &#123; label: 'Prompt attention' &#125;, &#123; label: 'Professional waiter' &#125; ] &#125;, &#123; label: 'Pleasant surroundings', icon: 'photo', children: [ &#123; label: 'Happy atmosphere', img: 'statics/parallax1.jpg' &#125;, &#123; label: 'Good table presentation', img: 'statics/parallax2.jpg' &#125;, &#123; label: 'Pleasing decor', img: 'statics/mountains.jpg' &#125; ] &#125; ] &#125; ] &#125;), methods: &#123; togglePropsGoodServiceExpand () &#123; const index = this.propsExpanded.indexOf('Good service') if (index &gt; -1) &#123; this.propsExpanded.splice(index, 1) &#125; else &#123; this.propsExpanded.push('Good service') &#125; &#125; &#125;&#125;&lt;/script&gt; Customizing nodes (header and body slots)&lt;template&gt; &lt;q-tree :nodes=\"customize\" node-key=\"label\" default-expand-all &gt; &lt;div slot=\"header-root\" slot-scope=\"prop\" class=\"row items-center\"&gt; &lt;img src=\"~assets/quasar-logo.svg\" class=\"avatar q-mr-sm\"&gt; &lt;div&gt; &#123;&#123; prop.node.label &#125;&#125; &lt;q-chip color=\"orange\" small&gt;New!&lt;/q-chip&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div slot=\"header-generic\" slot-scope=\"prop\" class=\"row items-center\"&gt; &lt;q-icon :name=\"prop.node.icon || 'star'\" color=\"orange\" size=\"28px\" class=\"q-mr-sm\" /&gt; &lt;div class=\"text-weight-bold text-primary\"&gt;&#123;&#123; prop.node.label &#125;&#125;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div slot=\"body-story\" slot-scope=\"prop\"&gt; &lt;span class=\"text-weight-thin\"&gt;The story is:&lt;/span&gt; &#123;&#123; prop.node.story &#125;&#125; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div slot=\"body-toggle\" slot-scope=\"prop\"&gt; &lt;p class=\"caption\"&gt;&#123;&#123; prop.node.caption &#125;&#125;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;q-toggle v-model=\"prop.node.enabled\" label=\"I agree to the terms and conditions\" /&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/q-tree&gt;&lt;/template&gt;&lt;script&gt;export default &#123; data: () =&gt; (&#123; customize: [ &#123; label: 'Satisfied customers', header: 'root', children: [ &#123; label: 'Good food', icon: 'restaurant_menu', header: 'generic', children: [ &#123; label: 'Quality ingredients', header: 'generic', body: 'story', story: 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.' &#125;, &#123; label: 'Good recipe', body: 'story', story: 'A Congressman works with his equally conniving wife to exact revenge on the people who betrayed him.' &#125; ] &#125;, &#123; label: 'Good service', header: 'generic', body: 'toggle', caption: 'Why are we as consumers so captivated by stories of great customer service?

Defaults to POST. extensions String Extensions to allow for uploading. Example: &#39;.gif,.jpg,.jpeg,.png&#39; multiple Boolean Allow multiple file uploads hide-upload-button Boolean Hides the Upload button. You can then trigger it manually by calling upload() on the Vue ref hide-upload-progress Boolean Hides the upload progress. Useful when you want some other means of signaling upload progress to the user. additional-fields Array Additional fields to send along the upload request. Useful for authentication and so on. Array of Objects containing name and value props. no-thumbnails Boolean Don’t display thumbnails when files are images. auto-expand Boolean Auto-expand the list of files when some are added to the queue. expand-style String/Array/Object Style of the expanded file list container. expand-class String/Array/Object Classes of the expanded file list container. send-raw Boolean Don’t use multipart/form-data and send the file content inside the request body. If using this approach you will need to specify the correct Content-Type header. Defaults to false. readonly Boolean If set to true, Uploader is displayed as read-only. clearable Boolean If set to true, the component offers the user an actionable icon to remove the current selection. Common input frame properties: Property Type Description prefix String A text that should be shown before the textfield. suffix String A text that should be shown after the textfield. float-label String A text label that will “float” up above the input field, once the input field gets focus. stack-label String A text label that will be shown above the input field and is static. color String One from Quasar Color Palette. inverted Boolean Inverted mode. Color is applied to background instead. inverted-light Boolean Inverted mode with a light color. Color is applied to background instead. dark Boolean Is QUploader rendered on a dark background? hide-underline Boolean Hides the bottom border. align String One of ‘left’, ‘center’ or ‘right’ which determines the text align within textfield. disable Boolean If set to true, Uploader is disabled and the user cannot change anything. error Boolean If set to true, the input fields colors are changed to show there is an error. before Array of Objects Icon buttons on left side of input frame.

Do not use on elements which already have :after pseudoelement. highlight-and-fade Adds a yellow background color and fades it away upon element is displayed. ellipsis Truncates text and shows ellipsis when not enough space available. ellipsis-2-lines Truncates text and shows ellipsis when not enough space available on two lines (works only on Webkit browsers). ellipsis-3-lines Truncates text and shows ellipsis when not enough space available on three lines (works only on Webkit browsers). z-top Positions your element on top of any other component, but behind Popovers, Tooltips, Notifications. z-max Positions your element on top of any other component (including Drawer, Modals, Notifications, Layout header/footer, …) Window Width RelatedFirst of all, let’s define what does a small, medium, big or large window means: Window Size Prefix Width threshold in pixels Extra Small xs Up to 576px Small sm Up to 768px Medium md Up to 992px Large lg Up to 1200px Extra Large xl Bigger than 1200px Now on to the window width related CSS classes. Class Name Description xs Display only on extra small windows sm Display only on small windows md Display only on medium-sized windows lg Display only on large windows xl Display only on extra large windows You can also show some DOM element or component if it’s lower than one of the sizes. Same for greater than one of the sizes. Just attach lt- or gt- prefixes, which come from “lower than” and “greater than”. Example: lt-md (display on xs and sm only), lt-xl (display on xs, sm, md and lg windows only), gt-md (display on greater than medium windows: lg and xl). NOTEYou can combine the visibility classes with the inline class for inline-blocks.Example : &lt;span class=&quot;gt-sm inline&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;and here is the end of this long sentence.&lt;/span&gt; Platform RelatedVisible only on: Class Name Description desktop-only Visible only on desktop mobile-only Visible only on mobile cordova-only Visible only on Cordova wrapped Apps electron-only Visible only on Electron wrapped Apps touch-only Visible only on touch capable platforms mat-only Visible only for Material Quasar Theme ios-only Visible only for iOS Quasar Theme platform-ios-only Visible only on an iOS platform platform-android-only Visible only on an Android platform within-iframe-only Visible only when entire website is under an IFRAME tag Hide on: Class Name Description desktop-hide Hide on desktop mobile-hide Hide on mobile cordova-hide Hide on Cordova wrapped Apps electron-hide Hide on Electron wrapped Apps touch-hide Hide on touch capable platforms mat-hide Hide for Material Quasar Theme ios-hide Hide for iOS Quasar Theme platform-ios-hide Hide on iOS platform platform-android-hide Hide on Android platform within-iframe-hide Hide only when entire website is under an IFRAME tag Also check Quasar Theming &gt; Platform Specific Styles.

This latter method allows you to not even render a DOM element or component. It is useful when the rendering process is expensive.

NOTEWeb Storage API only retrieves strings. Quasar retrieves data with its original data type. You tell it to store a Number then to retrieve it and it will still be a Number, not a string representation of the number as with Web Storage API. Same for JSON, Regular Expressions, Dates, Booleans and so on. Read below. InstallationEdit /quasar.conf.js:framework: &#123; plugins: [ 'LocalStorage', 'SessionStorage' ]&#125; Getting StartedQuasar supports both Local and Session Storage. // outside of a Vue fileimport &#123; LocalStorage, SessionStorage &#125; from 'quasar'LocalStorage.set(key, value)let value = LocalStorage.get.item(key)SessionStorage.set(key, value)let value = SessionStorage.get.item(key) // inside of a Vue filethis.$q.localStorage.set(key, value)let value = this.$q.localStorage.get.item(key)this.$q.sessionStorage.set(key, value)let value = this.$q.sessionStorage.get.item(key) Before we jump to discuss on the API, let’s see what data types are supported out of the box. Data TypesQuasar Storage supports (but not limited to) the following data types out of the box. If you store one of these types, the retrieved data will have the same data type. Dates Regular Expressions Numbers Booleans Strings Plain Javascript Objects If you store any other data type, the returned value will be a String. So you can even store functions, but be careful that you need to eval() the returned value (which is a String representation of the function).
